INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TURNING VIDEOHLP.TXT INTO AN ONLINE HELP


 - To turn VIDEOHLP.TXT into an online help, first you will need to
   download HelpPC 2.10+. HelpPC is available in the following ftp/http
   addresses: (and also in their mirrors)
     http://www.simtel.net/simtel.net/msdos/info.html (as helppc21.zip)
     ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/simtelnet/msdos/info/helppc21.zip

 - Unzip the downloaded file to a subdirectory, for example (C:\TC\HELPPC).
   This subdirectory I will call from now HelpPC subdirectory.
   Before continuing from this point, you'd better read HELPPC.DOC in HelpPC
   subdirectory to have a better idea of what you are going to do from this
   point.

 - Add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

     SET HLP=d:pathname	(no blanks, except between "SET HLP")

    Where 'd:' is the drive and 'pathname' is the HelpPC subdirectory
    (this should be fully qualified, with or without the trailing '\').

    For example:

     SET HLP=C:\TC\HELPPC

 - Move or copy VIDEOHLP.TXT to HelpPC subdirectory. If you have used
   INSTALL.BAT VIDEOHLP.TXT should also be at the \DOC subdirectory of your
   compiler (for example: C:\TC\DOC)

 - From HelpPC subdirectory, type:

     INDEXHLP VIDEOHLP

   or (if you desire also to include the .TXT help files provided by HelpPC,
   type:

     BUILD VIDEOHLP.TXT

 - Include HelpPC subdirectory in your path.

 To access the VIDEO HANDLING FUNCTIONS online help, just type from a DOS
 prompt HELPPC

 If you are using Turbo C++ 3.0 or similar, you may also include the online
 help in your compiler IDE. To do so, go to Options menu and them to Transfer...
 submenu. This will show a window with a box named Program Titles. Go to the
 last line, and click on Edit button. This will show another window. Fill that
 window with the desired title for HelpPC, HELPPC.COM plus it's path, and
 leave the last line empty. In the left side, assign a hot key and click on
 New (or Modify) button if everything is OK. Now the previous window should
 appear and you should see in it a new entry with the title you gave for
 HelpPC. If more than one entry for HelpPC appears, remove the exceeding
 entries for HelpPC. If everything is OK, click over the OK button. To test,
 just hit the assigned hot key when editing any file in the IDE.

 If you wish you may try to convert VIDEOHLP.TXT to a help format readable
 by THELP and them include VIDEOHLP into Turbo C++ online help. To do so,
 read CONVERT.TXT in this subdirectory.
