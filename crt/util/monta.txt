MONTA ver 2.0

MONTA.EXE is a simple program that is used to group text files (such as
source codes of programs in C and C++ or any other text files) in a large
text file easely editable by any DOS editor. It was created intending to
simplify the handling of many C/C++ source files (such as replacing the name
of a global variable that appears in many files) in projects with many files.
The large text file (archive) is created with .SRC extension, if none is
supplied. 

 It's usage is:

    MONTA [/B] filename[.SRC]           where:

    filename     pathname of archive
    /B           creates archive with binary file tags

MONTA.EXE allows nested archives, which means that you can store a
MONTA archive inside another.

Archives created by MONTA can be extracted by EXTRAIA.EXE

Example: 
   MONTA HELP.SRC MONTA.TXT EXTRAIA.TXT
 The above example will store MONTA.TXT (this file) and EXTRAIA.TXT in HELP.SRC

   Typing MONTA, the name of an existing archive and the names of files to be
stored. MONTA will prompt for the user (Overwrite/Append/Quit?).
If the user types O, the archive will be overwritten by the new files to
store.
If the user types A, the files to store will be included to the archive,
without removing the existing files from archive.
If the user types Q, MONTA will be finished.

THE /B option
   The /B option has been provided to allow compatibility with older versions,
such as the .SRC archives that comes with CRT1_6s.ZIP. This option instructs
MONTA to write binary file TAGS in the archive instead of normal ASCII TAGS.
The earlier versions writes only these binary file tags because they are much
smaller and easier to handle by computer. Although they are smaller, it's not
advisable to use these tags because most text editor's can't handle them very
well (I mean, even though they cause no problem to the editor, it's hard to
write them in hand (you might need a binary editor to do so) and most Windows
based editors can't display them correctly). They are displayed below:

Binary opentag => //filename
Binary closetag => //

   EXTRAIA doesn't recognize binary tags and normal ASCII tags simultaneously.
So creating archives with files stored by normal file TAGS and files stored
by binary file tags, will create archives with two types of stored files.
Those that can be extracted without (and only without) the /B switch, and
those that can be extracted with (and only with) the /B switch.
