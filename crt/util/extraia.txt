EXTRAIA ver 2.0b

EXTRAIA.EXE is a simple program that is used to ungroup text files (such as
source codes of programs in C and C++ or any other text files) grouped in one
.SRC large archive, created by hand or by MONTA utility.
 It's usage is:

    EXTRAIA filename[.SRC] [/B]       where:

    filename     pathname of archive
    /B           extracts archives with binary file tags.

The .SRC extension is optional. However if you don't specify the filename
extension EXTRAIA will assume it to be .SRC

The .SRC archive is usually a fully ASCII file where each stored file starts
in the immediate line after the file opening tag and ends in the preceding
line of a file closing tag. To be effective these tags must be at the
beginning of the line (excluding the first line, which is reserved for comments,
title, etc). The remaining space on the line after the file opentag is also
reserved for comments.

EXTRAIA.EXE allows nested archives, which means that a EXTRAIA/MONTA archive
can also stores other archives without misusing the end of a stored archive.

File tags:

The file opening tag (file opentag) is in the format of:
 //<FILE="filename">

The file closing tag (file closetag) is in the format of:
 //</FILE>

THE /B option
   The /B option has been provided to allow compatibility with older versions,
such as the .SRC archives that comes with CRT1_6s.ZIP. This option instructs
EXTRAIA to seek for binary file opentag and file closetag in the archive
instead of normal ASCII TAGS. The earlier versions recognized only these
binary file tags because they are much smaller and easier to handle by
computer. Although they are smaller, it's not advisable to use these tags
because most text editor's can't handle them very well (I mean, even though
they cause no problem to the editor, it's hard to write them in hand (you
might need a binary editor to do so) and most Windows based editors can't
display them correctly). They are:

Binary opentag => //filename
Binary closetag => //

   EXTRAIA doesn't recognize binary tags and normal ASCII tags simultaneously.
So when /B option is on, normal ASCII tags are considered as comments.

NOTICE: EXTRAIA doesn't recognize any file tag on the first line or in the
middle of any line because a file tag is actually composed of a
carriage-return/newline pair plus the tag as shown above. This is valid
for ASCII tags and binary tags.

A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE
   This is a very simple example of a .SRC archive. To test it you may use
EXTRAIA with this file or simply copy the lines below. REMEMBER, the file
opentag mustn't be on the first line. The file created will by DUMMY.FIL
//<FILE="DUMMY.FIL">
   HELLO WORLD!
//</FILE>

A VERY IMPORTANT EXAMPLE
   This example shows the results of misusing file tags and other EXTRAIA
features not listed above.
   Copy the lines below the dashed line and save it as a new filename, then
try EXTRAIA on it.
--------------------------------Example----------------------------------------
The first line is reserved for comments. If any tag is located on this line it will be ignored

The first file:
//<FILE="EXAMPLE1.TXT" Comments
Comments> The comments ends in the line with a '>' character if the tag is an ASCII tag.
This is the first example file. Run EXTRAIA again to check the nesting
capabilities of EXTRAIA. EXAMPLE2.TXT, NULL.TXT and EXAMPLE3.TXT will be
extracted
//<FILE="example2.txt">
Example 2
//</FILE>
  ways the tags doesn't work:
	//<FILE="ERROR1.TXT">
	 The file tags mustn't be in the first line or in the middle of a line
	//</FILE>
//<File="ErroR2.Txt">
The file tags must be in capital letters, but EXTRAIA is not case sensitive
with filenames.
//</File>

   If there's only one line between file opentag and file closetag, only the
contents of the line will be saved. If the line is empty the file
created will be zero in size (NULL.TXT).

//<FILE="NULL.TXT">This file is a empty file

//</FILE>
//<FILE="EXAMPLE3.TXT">
   A file open tag can be in the immediate line after a file close tag,
but they can't be in the same line.
   This is not true in the opposite case. Between a file open tag and a file
close tag there must be at least one line.
//</FILE>
//</FILE> end of example1.txt
