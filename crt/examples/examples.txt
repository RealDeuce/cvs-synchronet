   In this directory are some examples of VIDEO HANDLING FUNCTIONS. Some of
 them you can compile and use as programming utilities.
   The demo example/program is located at DEMO\ subdirectory in CRT2_1.ZIP
 main subdirectory.

* * * IMPORTANT:
   If the screen becomes unreadable or very strange after running some of
 these examples, use VOLTA.COM to recover the screen. VOLTA selects
 text mode 3, thus recovering the screen defaults.
   It's recommended to write down this name (VOLTA) in some piece of paper or
 somewhere else for cases of emergency.

Example of enhanced VIDEO HANDLING FUNCTIONS:
   In the subdirectory PLUS\ inside this subdirectory you will find a example
 that uses a enhanced version of mkline and crtframe - in fact crtframe is the
 same, but crtframe_mat is enhanced by the example - that enables drawing menu
 boxes with triple and quadruple outlines. To enable this a bitmapped font
 was created (DOSFONT\LINEDRW2.FNT)
   The example file is PLUS.CPP.  XMLINE.C and CRTFONT.C  aren't different
 examples, they are just required by PLUS.CPP.
   PLUS.CPP has in it's first lines a comment explaining how to compile it.
   You may try also to use these enhanced versions of mkline and crtframe in
 your own programs, to do so, include XMKLINE.C, and some lines from PLUS.CPP
 in your example. You may also include CRTFONT.C in your program.
   Sure it worths seeing this example.

   CRTFONT.C provides functions for reading and selecting a font stored in a
 file. I plan to include it in the VIDEO HANDLING FUNCTIONS main libraries
 in the next version.

WARNING:
   If you are running these examples under a MS-Windows MS-DOS prompt, be sure
 that the MS-DOS prompt is running in full screen mode, because some of the
 functions used by the examples may not be effective in a MS-DOS window.

   Many examples here requires at least an EGA video adapter or better (VGA)
