   This example/demo program includes all functions declared in CRT.H
 (some macros that works as functions (macro functions) might be missing)
 To run it type CRTTEST.
   NOTICE: Not all the examples of functions display the message
      <FUNCTION NAME> EXAMPLE

   The main source code file is CRTTEST.CPP
   The other three .CPP files are fonts used by changechar and changecharg
 examples in CRTTEST, they've been converted from the original .FNT files to
 .CPP format with FNTTOCPP.EXE available at \DOSFONT, and after edited to
 remove unnecessary character patterns in order to save disk space.
   To compile the demo example, type
	<line compiler name> CRTTEST
   For example, if your compiler is Turbo C, use:
	TCC CRTTEST

   IMPORTANT: If you are running this demo under a Windows MS-DOS prompt
 be sure that the MS-DOS prompt is running in full screen mode to see the
 effect of all functions, because some functions are not effective when they
 run in a MSDOS-prompt window.

   For further information about the functions, see \DOC\VIDEOHLP.TXT
