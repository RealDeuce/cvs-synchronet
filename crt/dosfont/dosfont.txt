Read first FILELIST.TXT to see the files contained in this directory
(DOSFONT\) with a brief description.

WARNING: This is still a beta version, I'm not sure if all programs here
work fine or if they are free of bugs, the source code of all .EXE files
is stored in DOSFONT\SOURCE\.

WARNING: If you run the programs in this subdirectory in a MS-DOS prompt under
Windows, be sure that the MS-DOS prompt is running in full screen mode,
because some functions used by these programs are not effective in a MS-DOS
prompt window.


INSTALLATION:
  Copy all files to a subdirectory and add that subdirectory to your path.

.FNT files:
   .FNT is a file format of files containing the bitmapped character patterns
 for all 256 Extended ASCII Character in raw format(it is, in the way they are
 loaded in video's RAM) and with no control data. Notice that .FNT files size
 is always a multiple of 256.
   The .FNT files can be edited with FONTEDIT and selected with FONTSEL. They
 can also be converted to C/C++ source code files with FNTTOCPP.
   If you think that in this subdirectory is too few .FNT files or that
 the fonts here are ugly, there are many nice fonts on the Internet. You
 may try the address below:
   http://www.simtel.net/msdos/screen.html
 
  .FNT Format:
 256 * (character height) Bytes => 256 character patters

 character pattern format: (character height) bytes
 byte 0 => Topmost scan line of character cell
 .
 .
 .
 byte (character height -1) => Lowermost scan line of character cell

 Each byte format:
           bit 7 is the left most of character CELL scan line
           bit 0 is the right most of character CELL scan line
         when bit is set, pixel is on

SEL.BAT:
   SEL.BAT works only in DOSFONT subdir. It is a batch files that calls
 FONTSEL.EXE and after DETECT.EXE.
 Example:
   SEL 12
 With this example, fontsel will select a character font with 12 pixels
 character height.

 SEL.BAT is nothing more than:
fontsel fonts\marcio%1.fnt /h%1 /r %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
detect

* * * IMPORTANT: SEL.BAT requires at least an EGA video adapter or better.

VOLTA.COM source code: (in Assembly language)
   mov ax,0003h
   int 10h
   mov ax,4c00h
   int 21h
   int 20h

MARCIO.CPI:
   MARCIO.CPI is a DOS codepage file with MARCIO.FNT, MARCIO14.FNT and
 MARCIO8.FNT font information. To select it add or edit the lines in
 the files:
 CONFIG.SYS:
   DEVICE=\DOS\DISPLAY.SYS CON=(EGA,,2)
 AUTOEXEC.BAT
   MODE CON CP PREP=((100)DOSFONT\MARCIO.CPI) => edit this line if DOSFONT\ isn't copied to the root of the same drive used by DOS
   MODE CON CP SEL=100

FNTTOCPP:
 Syntax:
   FNTTOCPP <source file [.FNT]> <character size> <name> <target file[.CPP]>
 Example:
   FNTTOCPP linedraw 16 linedraw_dta linefont
 The command line above will create LINEFONT.CPP with a array named
 linedraw_dta that stores the 256 character patterns defined in LINEDRAW.FNT
   Notice: You must give character_size and array name.

FONTEDIT:
 Syntax:
   FONTEDIT <font name[.FNT]> [Height]
 Example:
   FONTEDIT maluco

   You must give a name, but height is optional (default=16)

   To create new fonts, copy a existing one with copy command to the file
 you want to create, as the example below:
   COPY MALUCO.FNT LICOS.FNT
 Then edit the created file (in the example LICOS.FNT)
 For more information, read FONTEDIT.DOC

* * * IMPORTANT: FONTEDIT.EXE requires at least an EGA video adapter or better.

FONTRESZ:
 For help and syntax, type FONTRESZ with no parameters.
 Example:
   FONTRESZ linedraw 16 linedr32 32

FONTSEL:
 Type FONTSEL /? for help and syntax.
 Examples:
   FONTSEL LINEDRAW
   FONTSEL MARCIO8 /r /m1 /h8

 The block specifier option /C has the following bitfields:
 R1:R0:L2:D2:L1:L0:D1:D0
 MSB                  LSB
  Where:
  R1:R0 => reserved
  L2:L1:L0 => defines the block that is selected by characters with light colors
  D2:D1:D0 => defines the block that is selected by characters with dark colors
  Bits L2 and D2 are available only in VGA and better video adapters.

* * * IMPORTANT: FONTSEL.EXE requires at least an EGA video adapter or better.

Compile also the examples in EXAMPLE\ subdir, there are many useful utilities
to use with DOSFONT.

For further information read README.1ST (at CRT2_1.ZIP main subdir)

DOSFONT is freeware!!!
The fonts in this subdirectory can be distributed in any format and also
included in other programs.
