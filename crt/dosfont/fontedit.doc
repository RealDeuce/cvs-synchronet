	   * * * FONTEDIT ver 1.3 HELP AND DOCUMENTATION * * *


   FONTEDIT is a freeware program that enables to change DOS bitmapped fonts
(.FNT). To select fonts edited by FONTEDIT, use FONTSEL.

 Syntax:
   FONTEDIT <font name[.FNT]> [Height]
 Example:
   FONTEDIT maluco

   You must give a name, but height is optional (default=16)

   To create new fonts, copy a existing one with copy command to the file
 you want to create, as the example below:
   COPY MALUCO.FNT LICOS.FNT
 Then edit the created file (in the example LICOS.FNT)

   FONTEDIT supports mouse (Microsoft compatible) and requires at least
an EGA video adapter (preferably VGA or SVGA).
   If FONTEDIT works with non MS compatible mouses, please tell me.

   FONTEDIT was designed to run under DOS, but it also works under Windows,
provided that it is running in full screen mode or under true DOS sessions.

   This version of FONTEDIT displays five windows when it is started. Some
of them can be turned off by the user.

   The leftmost window is the character pattern edit window, where the user
can change the shape of current selected character. It is always visible.
This window will be reffered as Edit window. When the font is changed, a
star appears on the bottom of this window. When the font is saved, it
disapears.

   On the middle, appears the Character Set window. This window displays
the characters with their default patterns. It can be toggled on/off by
pressing ALT and A keys simultaneously.

   On the right, appears a Miniature of the selected character (Miniature
window) and a miniature of the pattern stored in the clipboard (Clipboard
window). They can be toggled on/off by pressing ALT-M and ALT-B,
respectively.

   Over the Miniature and the Clipboard window appears a message reporting
the selected character index and it's default character pattern.

   Near the bottom of the screen appears a window with a brief help of
FONTEDIT commands. This window cannot be turned off.

   To display the edited font, use FONTSEL with /R /H?? /A options.

   To exit, press ESC. If the user attempts to exit without saving first
the font (if it was changed) a dialog window will pop-up. The user may
choose between saving the modifications and then exit, or exit and discard
every unsaved modification, or returning to the program, by pressing the
Cancel key. This dialog window doesn't support TAB and ENTER keys.
   To save the font, press F2.

   To select a character to be edited, use PG-UP, PG-DNW, CTRL-PG-UP,
CTRL-PG-DNW or ALT-(arrow keys) to browse the Character Table. If the
Character Set window is visible, you may choose the character directly by
moving the mouse cursor over the desired character and them pressing the
mouse left button or Enter key. Note that the ALT-(arrow keys) are active
even if the Character Set window is not visible, it is, you can browse the
Character Set window even if its not visible.
   The table below shows how much the selected character index is incremented
or decremented after hitting the following keys:
   PG-UP, PG-DWN, ALT-LEFT and ALT-RIGHT..................1
   CTRL-PG-UP and CTRL-PG-DWN............................16
   ALT-UP and ALT-DWN....................................32

   To change the shape of the selected character, move the mouse cursor to
the Edit window on the left. Press mouse buttons or +, -, ENTER keys to edit
the character. The mouse cursor can be moved by the mouse and also by the
keyboard arrows (for a more precise action). If no mouse is installed, the
text mode cursor will appear inside the Edit window. To move it, use the
arrow keys, and press keys +, - or ENTER to edit the character.

   CTRL-C or CTRL-INS copies the pattern from the Edit window to the
   clipboard.

   CTRL-V pastes the pattern stored in the clipboard over the selected
   character pattern.

   CTRL-(arrows) move the pattern for up, down, sides.

   ALT-I inverts the colors of the character pattern.

   ALT-C clears the character pattern.

   ALT-V, ALT-H flips the character pattern.
   ALT-R rotates the character pattern 180 degrees.

   The clipboard is not editable.

* * * IMPORTANT: I haven't done all the tests required to assure that * * *
* * * FONTEDIT is free of errors, so it might not work properly in    * * *
* * * some system configurations (those I haven't tested), hence use  * * *
* * * it with CARE and at your OWN RISK. In brief: This is still a    * * *
* * * BETA version. If you find any error or if you have any comment, * * *
* * * please e-mail me:						      * * *
