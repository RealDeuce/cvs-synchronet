Greatly improved mouse support, use the Synchronet ciolib

Well, I've got it working for me.  :-)
It now runs (apparently) flawlessly on FreeBSD at the CONSOLE.
Mouse and SVGALIB preview not ported... is the SVGALIB preview really something
we need?  Mouse stuff I'll do eventually.

Notes:
------
If you run Mystic Draw in XTerm, there's a few things to be aware of:
1) SHIFT-Fx doesn't work... use CTRL and the top row of letters on the keyboard
   (QWERTYUIOP) ie: use CTRL-Q instead of SHIFT-F1 etc...
2) CTRL-<arrow> doesn't work for changing colours.  Use CTRL-A/CTRL-D for the
   foreground colour and CTRL-Z/CTRL-C for the background colour.
3) Some characters are missing and the character sets are different.  This
   is due to XTerms high-ascii control codes.  If I should these chars to you,
   you wouldn't like what you got... honest.
4) Blinking text just plain DOES NOT WORK.  Furthermore, you can't tell if text
   is blinking or not... so if you use this in XTerm be VERY carefull with it.

I may port this mess to Windows soon... but I really should clean up the code
first... being ported from a DOS version of Pascal really didn't help it any.
:-)

I may also port this back to Linux if I ever manage to get it installed here.

MYSTIC DRAW
Mystic Draw was my first C program. I wrote it first early 1994 in a language called
Turbo Pascal under DOS (yes from that company in Redmond) and 1994-95 when 
I get my first Linux System my first program was Mystic Draw :)
Ansi drawing tools are completely outdated, I know,I know ...
but maybe this tool helps anyone, the C code is rubbish (Pascal - Style), but
the program works. If someone find this tool helpful, write me a mail, maybe
I fix some bugs (I did fix some bugs 97, but this source is gone ... damn
harddisk).
