Right-mouse problem (fixed?)
Tab setup at start
Effect thing weird (at startup only?)
"At start" may actually be "when .synctermrc is created"
When Set color chosen from menu, top-line "Color" indicator appears - breaking menu
Everything when chosen from the menu, hides the menu... is this a Good Thing?
Load screen is horrible
Sauce Setup horrible
Help screen is horrible too
ESC from drawmode brings up About box (???)
Fast mouse movement in draw modes leaves holes
"Skins" to set the attributes and box style?  Some people may LIKE ugly
Set the application title to "SyncDraw" or something... currently left blank somehow
syncdraw.config should become syncdraw.ini
