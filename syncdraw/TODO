Load screen is horrible
Sauce Setup horrible
Help screen is horrible too

Problems when no .config file exists...
Tab setup at start
Effect thing weird (at startup only?)
syncdraw.config should become syncdraw.ini
The defaults would also take care of the first two problems.

When Set color chosen from menu, top-line "Color" indicator appears - breaking menu
ESC from drawmode brings up About box (Fixed?)
Fast mouse movement in draw modes leaves holes
"Skins" to set the attributes and box style?  Some people may LIKE ugly

Properly save 80-column drawings... possibly warn first?
	Best method (using movement codes) is as follows:
		At Start of 80-column line:
			1) Move down one line (Using LF - force scroll if it will happen)
			2) Move up one line (back to original position)
			3) Save position
		At End of 80-column line:
			1) Restore position
			2) Move down one line using CR/LF to ensure a proper end of line
		On last line, do not do special start/end unless the last line is 80 columns.
	Second best method (for types without movement):
		At end of 80-column line, instead of \r\n, use <space><backspace>
			- This method will not work correctly for non 80-column terminals
			- Can result in overly long lines... breaking things which use a
			  fixed-length line buffer while reading input files (ex: ddplus doors)
Support loading, editing, and ANSI-selecting console fonts
