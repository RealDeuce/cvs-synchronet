Upgrading from Synchronet Match Maker 
-------------------------------------

If you are a registered owner of SMM and upgrading from v1.10 or earlier,
you'll need to optain your registration number from Digital Dynamics by calling
voice at 714-529-6328. You will need to have your Synchronet registration
number and control code on hand when you call.

The most important change (in upgrading to v2.0) is to change "Intercept
I/O Interrupts" in SCFG from "Yes" to "No". Example:

  left (similar to SBBS)

New in version 2.02a
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Fixed bug in SMM.EXE when using DOOR.SYS (non-Synchronet BBSs)

New in version 2.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Low priority input now correctly supported (for giving up multitasker time
  slices even while accepting string input from the user) - this was an
  indirect bug fix in XSDK v2.41 most notably effecting OS/2 systems
o "Searching..." text now displayed before possibly long searches to indicate
  to the user the system is not crashed

  in addition to the normal user-viewable text fields

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o New DELPHOTO.EXE utility to delete photos from the database

  photos

o New SMM, SMMCFG, and SMMUTIL fix 25 character BBS name limit
o SMMUTIL (v2.00) now removes old photos (tallys photos and networked profiles)

New in version 2.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Optionally reads from and writes to DOOR.SYS drop file
  (for compatibility with other [non-Synchronet] BBS programs)
o MSG, UTI, and possibly JAM message base import/export utilities will be
  available soon (for match maker networking with non-SMB compatible BBSs)

  (with Zmodem download and local viewing)

  (other match maker networks will need to use their own distribution methods)
o System name separately configurable in SMMCFG (to work around duplicate BBS
  names in a match maker network)
o Metric measurements (centimeters and kilograms) can be enabled in SMMCFG

  displays extended profile on the user and then exits (just "SMM user name")

o Condensed Wall listings now clear the screen between each screen-full
  (faster screen draws) with a prompt allowing the user to read a profile,
  send a telegram, move backwards through the wall writings, or quit at the

  sending telegrams. If a user adds a profile and then deletes it, the credit
  charges are reversed.
