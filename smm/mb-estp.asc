ESTPs in short:

Matter-of-fact, do not worry or hurry, enjoy whatever comes along.
Tend to like mechanical things and sports, with friends on the
side.  May be a bit blunt or insensitive.  Adaptable, tolerant,
generally conservative in values.  Dislike long explanations.  Are
best with real things that can be worked, handled, taken apart or
put together.

About 13% of the population.

Details about ESTPs:

ESTPs are men and women of action.  When someone of this
personality is present, things begin to happen.  The lights come
on, the music plays, the game begins.  And a game it is for the
ESTP, The outstanding entrepreneur, the international diplomat, the
conciliator, and the negotiator 'par excellence.'

Approximately 13 percent of the general population are of this
extroverted, sensing, thinking, perceiving type, and if only one
adjective could be used to describe ESTPs 'resourceful' would be an
apt choice.

Life is never dull around ESTPs.  Their attractive, friendly style
has a theatrical flourish which makes even the most routine,
mundane event seem exciting.  ESTPs usually know the location of
the best restaurants, and headwaiters are likely to call them by
name.  ESTPs are socially sophisticated, suave, and urbane and are
master manipulators of the external environment.

ESTPs are uncanny at observing people's motivations, somehow
hypersensitive to minimal nonverbal cues which other types might
miss.  And they are masters at using these observations to "sell"
the "client."  The eye of the ESTP is ever on the eye of the
beholder, and all actions are directed toward this audience.

Witty, clever, and fun, ESTPs seem to possess an unusual amount of
empathy, when in fact this is not the case; rather, they are so
acutely aware of minimal signals from others that they are usually
several jumps ahead in anticipation of another's position.  And
ESTPs can use information gained to the ends they have in mind -
apparently with nerves of steel, engaging in what seems to others
to be suicidal brinkmanship.  Other types may find this exhausting,
but ESTPs are exhilarated by working close to the edge of disaster.

ESTPs are ruthless pragmatists and often offer the ends as
justification for whatever means they see as necessary -
regrettable, perhaps, but necessary.  Usually, however, ESTPs do
not care to justify actions, but prefer instead to get on to the
next action.

ESTPs are outstanding as initiators of enterprises that bring
people together to negotiate.  They make invaluable itinerant
administrators who can pull troubled companies or institutions out
of the red very quickly, and with style!

They can sell an idea or project in a way no other type can, but
won't follow through on the tedious administrative details of a
project.  This characteristic often causes ESTPs to be
unappreciated for the extraordinary talents they have, for people
lose sight of the idea contributed and focus on the details left
undone, becoming critical of ESTPs' weaknesses rather than
appreciating their strength.

Few enterprises which are institutionally based use ESTPs as they
should be used.  When they strike out on their own, however, they
do not always succeed, for their unwillingness to bother with
follow-up details may cause an otherwise excellent project to fail.
ESTPs need to be sure they have someone who will take care of
follow-up if at all possible.

If the promotional, entrepreneurial capabilities of ESTPs are used
to constructive ends, an institution is fortunate for their
presence.

If their desire for excitement is not met constructively, however,
these energies may be channeled into destructive, antisocial
activities such as those of the confidence rackets -
counterfeiting, bad-check artistry, safe-cracking, and swindling. A
movie of the early 1970's which caught this use of the ESTP's
talent was The Sting.

ESTPs live in the immediate moment and as mates lend excitement -
and unpredictability - to the relationship.  The ESTP mate is
usually extremely attentive in public and smooth in social rituals.
They carry on amusing repartee, and laughter surrounds them as they
recount from their endless supply of clever jokes and stories.

Charm radiates from ESTPs.  Nothing is too good for their friends,
although family responsibilities may, at times, be given second
priority.  The ESTP's mate may in time come to feel like an object
- the female a chattel and the male a negotiable commodity.  Deep
commitments do not always occur in the lives of ESTPs, although
they are always popular and know many, many people by name.

Relationships usually are conditional, and the condition is the
consideration of what the ESTP has to gain  from the relationship.
Anything gained, however, is shared freely and generously with the
mate.  The unexpected gift, the impulsive trip to Paris, the
extravagant surprise at Christmas - all these an ESTP brings to a
mate.  Fun, excitement, laughter, and that element of
unpredictability are characteristic of their relationship.

The ESTPs have a low tolerance for anxiety and are apt to avoid or
leave situations that are consistently filled with interpersonal
tensions.  ESTPs are usually somewhat of a mystery to their mates
and to others.  Few people comprehend this unique personality.

ESTPs themselves understand well the maxim, "He who travels
fastest, travels alone."  Still, ESTPs are not likely to be lonely
for long.

ESTPs meet life with a hearty appetite for the good things of the
world, searching out excitement, perhaps as a warrior, an athlete,
an adventurer, or as a professional gambler, but always seeking the
thrill of courting Lady Luck in one fashion or another.  A theme of
seeking excitement through taking of risks runs through the lives
of ESTPs.
