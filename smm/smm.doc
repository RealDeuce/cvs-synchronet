Synchronet Installation (if you are using Synchronet BBS Software)
==================================================================

Synchronet Match Maker (SMM) comes pre-installed in Synchronet BBS v2.1 and
later. If match maker has been pre-installed in your system, see the file
UPGRADE.DOC for details on installing a newer version over an older version
(upgrading).

Create the following sub-directory off of your main Synchronet directory
(e.g. C:\SBBS):

XTRN\SMM	(The XTRN directory should already exist)

(example: C:\SBBS\XTRN\SMM)

Copy the files included in the archive or on the floppy disk into this
directory. The DEMO and registered versions of this program are identical.
The registration number must be obtained from Digital Dynamics and entered
into the Match Maker configuration program (SMMCFG) to convert the DEMO into
a registered copy.

Licenses for registered use of Synchronet Match Maker are sold separately from
Synchronet BBS Software. Once a registration number has been issued, no refunds
or returns of Synchronet Match Maker will be accepted.

Run SCFG (Synchronet Configuration Program) and add the Match Maker to one
of your External Program Sections and configure as follows:

If you wish to have old profile entries and wall writings automatically deleted
from your match maker, you will need to run the SMMUTIL program periodically to
remove profiles that haven't been updated in a certain number of days
(specified on the SMMUTIL command line). To set up a timed event in SCFG->
External Programs->Timed Events for SMMUTIL:

    ษออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออป

This would have SMMUTIL remove all profiles that haven't been updated in the
past 90 days and all wall writings older than 7 days.

It will also create the file SMMSTATS.TXT in your XTRN\SMM directory with
detailed statistics on the demographics of the current SMM profile database.
You may want to make this file available for download or as a viewable bulletin
on your BBS.

If you are currently on DOVE-Net or FidoNet and you carry the "Synchronet Data"
(SYNCDATA) message area and wish to link your match maker database with other
BBSs through this message area, set up the following two Timed Events in SCFG:

Change "syncdata" in the above examples to the internal code you have used
for the "Synchronet Data" echo. Also, if you are not running v2.1+ of
Synchronet, you must specify the full path to the DATA directory instead of
using the %j. If your "Synchronet Data" echo is stored on a different
drive or in a different directory than SBBS, then you must specify that drive
and path on the above command lines.

To get your match maker database active immediately, you may want to reset
your message pointers for the "Synchronet Data" echo on your hub BBS. If
using QWKnet, you would accomplish this by posting the message in the
"Synchronet Data" echo on your BBS to "SBBS" with a title of "RESET". The
message body does not matter.

Swapping
--------
If you get memory allocation errors during the execution of any of the above
event command lines, add that program name to your Global Swap List in SCFG.

DOOR.SYS BBS Installation (if you are using BBS software OTHER than Synchronet)
===============================================================================

Your BBS software must be able to create the industry standard DOOR.SYS drop
file (35 lines or more). If you wish to charge credits for specific match maker
functions (adding profile, sending telegrams, etc) your BBS software must be
able to READ BACK in the modified DOOR.SYS drop file (e.g. GAP BBS software).
Credits are read from line 31 of the DOOR.SYS file (in K) and credits used
while in SMM are written to line 30 of the DOOR.SYS (in K) and total credits
after adjustment (in K) are written back to line 31 of the DOOR.SYS. Since the
DOOR.SYS format only supports one set of flags (line 23), flag set 1 will be
the only valid flag set to use for the security options in SMMCFG (i.e. flag
sets 2-4 will not be used).

Create a directory for Synchronet Match Maker (SMM) and copy all the files
into it (example: C:\BBS\DOORS\SMM).

Copy the files included in the archive or on the floppy disk into this
directory. The DEMO and registered versions of this program are identical.
The registration number must be obtained from Digital Dynamics and entered
into the Match Maker configuration program (SMMCFG) to convert the DEMO into
a registered copy.

Once a registration number has been issued, no refunds or returns of Synchronet
Match Maker will be accepted.

If you are running a multinode BBS, you will need to have the DOOR.SYS created
in a separate directory for each node (i.e. NOT the directory where SMM has
been installed). This will prevent drop file collisions if two users enter SMM
at the same time. The complete path to the DOOR.SYS must be specified on the
command line, so each node must have a different path specified. Example:

Node 1 Command Line:	SMM C:\BBS\NODE1\DOOR.SYS
Node 2 Command Line:	SMM C:\BBS\NODE2\DOOR.SYS

SHARE must be loaded in your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT for SMM to function
(in single node or multinode environments).

If non-standard IRQs or I/O addresses are used, they must be specified on the
SMM command line using the Command Line Options. IRQs 2-15 are fully supported.
Shared IRQs are not supported in UART mode.

16550 FIFO buffered UARTs are detected and enabled.

DTE rates up to 115200 baud are supported (higher with proprietary hardware).

Command Line Options:
====================

Command line options override the values (if present) in the DOOR.SYS file.
No command line options are required when used with Synchronet BBS software.

	/P#	Set the COM port (0=local only) (normally not necessary)

		Example: /P1 to specify COM1
			 /P0 to specify no COM port (local use)

	/C#	Set the COM port type or I/O (D:DigiBoard, F:FOSSIL, E:EBIOS)

		Example: /CF to specify FOSSIL
			 /C3e8 to specify I/O address 3e8 (hexadecimal)

	/I#	Set the COM port IRQ or channel (only required if non-standard)

		Example: /I5 to specify IRQ 5
			 /I0 to specify FOSSIL/Digi Channel 0

	/R#	Set the COM port DTE rate (normally not necessary)

		Example: /R57600 to specify a DTE rate of 57600 baud

	/T#	Set time-slice APIs supported (default: DESQview if detected)

		Example: /T1 to use INT28 time-slice API
			 /T2 to use Win/OS2 time-slice API
			 /T4 to disable DESQview detection and time-slice API

If a user name is specified on the command line, that user's profile will be
automatically looked up and displayed.

	Example (Synchronet): SMM JOHN DOE

	Example (non-Synchronet): SMM C:\BBS\NODE1\DOOR.SYS JOHN DOE

The current directory MUST be the directory where SMM has been installed
(e.g. C:\BBS\DOORS\SMM) when SMM is executed. Some non-Synchronet BBS packages
may require a batch file to change drive and/or directory before running SMM
and may require the same batch file re-load the BBS software. Example:

	@ECHO OFF
	CD \BBS\DOORS\SMM
	SMM \BBS\NODE1\DOOR.SYS
	REM The following may not be necessary with some BBS packages
	CD \BBS\NODE1
	BBS

Configuration
=============

SMMCFG
------
SMMCFG.EXE is used to modify your SMM.CFG (Configuration) file. Hitting the F1
key will display a help page on the currently selected menu or option.

System Name
-----------
The most important option in this program is your System Name (BBS Name). If
you are running Synchronet BBS Software, this option does not have to be set
here (it is automatically passed to SMM in the XTRN.DAT drop file from
Synchronet). If it is set, it will override the name specified in SCFG->System
->BBS Name.

If you have registered SMM for non-Synchronet BBS Software, this option must be
set to the exact BBS name you registered SMM for (not case sensitive).

Once you have setup SMM and your BBS users have entered their profiles, it is
important that you DO NOT change your BBS name, or you will lose those
profiles (and likely upset your users). If you are networking your match maker
database with other BBSs, it is important that you do not have the same System
Name as another BBS in the network. Only the first 25 characters of the BBS
name are used and every BBS in an SMM network must have a unique BBS name. Your
System Name (configured in SMMCFG) does not have to match your actual BBS name
(as configured in your BBS software). This allows you to change your System
Name for match maker networks where your real BBS name is already in use.

Profile Database Security

	ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

The Profile Database Security sub-menu allows you to define who can add
profiles by security level, age, and flags as well as the minimum age for
the purity test. Flag sets 2-4 are used only with Synchronet BBS software.

Minimum Levels
--------------
From the SMMCFG main menu you can change the minimum levels required to
send telegrams, write on the wall, read questionnaires, and perform sysop
functions.

Minor Segregation (Protection) Age
----------------------------------
This option separates all users into Minors (those users below the specified
age) and Adults (those users at or above the specified age). When this option
is used, adults cannot see minors' profiles or send them telegrams (and vice
versa). This feature does not keep adult users on other non-segregated
networked BBSs from sending telegrams to minors on your BBS (or minors on other
BBSs from sending telegrams to adults on your BBS) - this can lead to confusion
among users receiving telegrams from users that don't appear to be in the
database (due to segregation on your system). This option is disabled by
default.

Auto-Update Profiles
--------------------
This option allows you to change the number of days between automatic
profile updates across a match maker network. Normally a user's profile will
not be sent out across the network unless the user makes a change to their
profile. This option allows you to have their profile automatically sent
every so many days as long as the user is active in the match maker (enters
the match maker and uses it). This is useful for keeping profile databases
up-to-date across the network as new systems come online. Setting this option
to 0 disables this feature. The default value (30) should be fine for most
configurations.

Notify User of Activity
-----------------------
This is the number of the user who will be notified of match maker activity
(profiles added, telegrams sent, wall writings, etc). Normally this option will
be set to 1 (for user #1, the sysop). Setting this option to 0 disables this
feature.

Use Metric System
-----------------
If you want all heights and weights to be displayed in centimeters and
kilograms instead of inches and pounds, set this option to "Yes". Since all
measurements are internally stored in inches and pounds, those (English)
measurements are the most accurate. Some measurements may change slightly
when converting from metric to English and back.

Zmodem Send Command
-------------------
This is the command line to execute to send a file via Zmodem to the remote
user. The default command line (%!dsz portx %u,%i sz %f) should work for most
system configurations (assuming DSZ is in your Synchronet EXEC directory or
DOS search path and using UART serial ports on all nodes). The percent codes
in the command line are called "Command Line Specifiers" and are explained
later in this document.

Local Photo Viewer
------------------
This is the command line to execute to view photos when running SMM locally.
The percent codes in the command line are called "Command Line Specifiers" and
are explained later in this document.

SMM.CAN
-------

The trash can file (SMM.CAN) can be used to specify a list of words or word
combinations (one word or word combination per line) that will not be allowed
in user information and wall entries.

QUE.LST
-------

The questionnaire list file (QUE.LST) can be edited with any ASCII text editor.
The following is the stock QUE.LST containing the four stock questionnaires.

BASIC
Basic Personality
0
APPEAR
Appearance
0
MATERIAL
Material
0
ADULT
Adult Sexuality
18

For each questionnaire, a code (up to eight valid DOS filename chars),
a description (up to 25 chars), and minimum age are specified. A maximum
of five questionnaires can be configured. If you are linked to the Synchronet
Data echo, it is suggested you leave the four stock questionnaires intact
(unmodified). If you change any of these questionnaires, you MUST change the
code to something other than "BASIC, APPEAR, MATERIAL, or ADULT" as these codes
are reserved specifically for the stock questionnaires. If you are not linked
to the Synchronet Data echo, you can modify and remove any questionnaires you
wish and use whatever code you wish except "PURITY" and "MB-TYPE" as these
questionnaire names are specifically reserved by the Match Maker.

The questionnaires are stored in files with the code for the name and .QUE
as the file extension (e.g. BASIC.QUE, APPEAR.QUE, MATERIAL.QUE, etc).

*.QUE Format
------------

A: First line is total number of questions (max: 20).
   All lines following are question and answers groups.

B: Each group starts with the actual question (max: 79 characters).

C: The next line in the group consists of the total number of answers
   (max: 16).

D: The next line consists of the maximum number of answers this user can select
   for this question.

E: A single line for each answer (total answers from line C).

F: Repeat lines B-E for each question (total questions from line A).

Special Questionnaire Files
---------------------------

Two questionnaire files (MB-TYPE.QUE and PURITY.QUE) are unique in that they
don't follow the above format at all and should need no modification.

The MB-TYPE.QUE is used for the Myers-Briggs personality test and is a pretty
standard questionnaire. The files MB-*.ASC are descriptions of the various
personality types. The file MB-INTRO.ASC is displayed before the test and
MB-TYPE.ASC is displayed when seeking descriptions of the various types.

The PURITY.QUE is used for the purity test and the format is simply one
"Have you ever" question per line. The default PURITY.QUE is a 100 question
test of an adult nature. An optional 500 question purity test is also included
as PURITY.500. To use this test in place of the 100 question version, copy
PURITY.500 to PURITY.QUE. The 100 question version is also included as
PURITY.100 as a back-up, in case you want to return to the 100 question
version. The PURITY*.ASC files are displayed before and during the testing
procedure.

Sysop Commands
==============

From the Match Maker main menu, the sysop (any user with sysop security level)
can use the (D)elete command to remove any profile from the database. Profiles
can be undeleted with the '*' command (available only to sysops).

When viewing profiles, sysops are shown the user name, number, and system
name at the top of the profile. Normal users are not shown this information
to maintain the anonymity of the users in the database.

Hitting '!' will display a list of all networked BBSs that have contributed to
the current profile database. If you see your BBS name in the list, either
someone else is using the same BBS name as you (which is bad), or something has
gone wrong in your network and you should contact Digital Dynamics to remedy
the situation immediately. If someone else is using the exact same BBS name
(not considering upper/lower case differences), one of you must change your BBS
name by at least one character or you will definitely have problems with your
users' Match Maker profiles and telegrams.

Hitting '\' will rebuild the database index. If your database is corrupted,
you should down all your nodes and use SMMUTIL instead of this command. If
your SMM.IXB file disappears or becomes out-of-sync with your SMM.DAB file
(which is unlikely to occur), you can use this command to quickly recreate
it.

Photographs
===========

You may use the included ADDPHOTO.EXE utility to import photographs into your
local match maker database. The current directory must be the directory where
SMM is installed when ADDPHOTO is run. The usage is:

ADDPHOTO filename.ext user_number system_name

where filename.ext is the path, filename, and extension of the photograph file
to import (preferably, but not necessarily, a JPEG file with a .JPG extension).
User_number is the user's number and system_name is the name of the system the
user created their profile on.

ADDPHOTO will create a directory called PHOTO off of the directory where SMM
is installed (e.g. C:\SBBS\XTRN\SMM\PHOTO or C:\BBS\DOORS\SMM\PHOTO) and move
the photograph file into this directory (changing the name, but leaving the
extension (e.g. JPG, GIF, TIF, etc) intact.

Example:

		ADDPHOTO JAMIEFAR.JPG 1 M.A.S.H BBS

The DELPHOTO.EXE utility is used to remove photographs from your local match
maker database. The usage is:

DELPHOTO user_number system_name

Example:
		DELPHOTO 1 M.A.S.H BBS

The LSTPHOTO.EXE utility may be used to create a list of all users with photos
in your local match maker database.

Example:
		LSTPHOTO > PHOTO.LST

PHOTO.ZIP
---------
You can optionally, zip (using PKZIP) all the files in the PHOTO directory
into a file called PHOTO.ZIP (in the SMM directory) and delete them from the
PHOTO directory (to save disk space). When the photo is viewed or downloaded
from SMM, it will be automatically extracted from the PHOTO.ZIP into the PHOTO
directory (PKUNZIP.EXE must be in your DOS search path or your Synchronet
EXEC directory). The ADDPHOTO utility will not automatically add new images to
the PHOTO.ZIP (if you wish to use that storage method). Also, the files will
not be automatically deleted from the PHOTO directory after download/viewing
in SMM. This is so that popular image files will not have to be extracted each
time. You may wish to periodically re-zip and delete the PHOTO directory
(perhaps with an event) to preserve disk space.

SYNCDATA Echo
-------------
If your match maker is linked (via DOVE-Net or FidoNet) to the SYNCDATA echo,
you do not need a scanner or the ADDPHOTO utility to get your users' photos
into the database. Simply have your users send their photos along with your
full and correct BBS name, their user number, and a xerox-copy of a current
formal photo-ID (to verify identity only, IDs will not be scanned and all
ID information will remain completely confidential) to Digital Dynamics.

The photos must have a 2 inch square drawn around the area to be scanned. The
photos will be scanned and distributed in JPEG format (with monthly
redistribution) on the SYNCDATA echo by Digital Dynamics. This service is
available to all users of SMM free of charge (this free offer _may_ expire
on Feb 14th, 1996).

Digital Dynamics reserves the right to refuse to scan and distribute any
photos for any reason. Nudity or vulgarities will not be allowed.

Photos and IDs included with a self-addressed _stamped_ enveloped will be
returned.

DEMO Version
============

The unregistered "DEMO" version of Synchronet Match Maker will not allow
users to send Telegrams to other users in the database (through the
message network), write on the Match Maker wall, or read other users'
questionnaires.
