The Feeler tends toward subjective & social values, personal feelings, 
harmony, intimacy, sympathy and devotion. The F overextends himself to meet
others needs, enjoys serving people, tends to retract statements that offend
others, asks himself 'how will this affect the people involved'.
The feeler feels the thinker has ice in his veins.
The population is equally divided between Ts and Fs, although more men tend
to be Thinkers & more women tend to be Feelers.
