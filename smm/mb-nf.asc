The purpose of life for an NF is to find his purpose in life. NF is self in
search of self & has difficulty understanding what seem to be the false goals
of others. Search for identity, meaning, & actualization. Believes his real
self is somewhat less than what it should be. Desires to be genuine,
transparent; without masks or game-playing. Life is a drama; each encounter
is pregnant with becoming. Very sensitive to non-verbal communication.
Relationships can fall into a pattern of generous investment of energy followed
by disappointment in what-could-have-been. Tend to be writers, poets, musicians
teachers, counselors, actors; excellent communicators; gift of helping people 
grow; strong empathy. Good at appearing to be what the beholder wants to see.
Seeks greater intensity in relationships, seeks elusive intimacy. At once both
the audience and the actor. Often has difficulty putting limits on time & 
energy spent at work. Seeks perfection; and is often disappointed. Tends to
romanticize experience. Hunger for relationships.
NF strengths are a capacity for working with people & drawing out their best,
being articulate & persuasive, a strong desire to help others, and the ability
to affirm others freely & easily.
As a manager, NF has difficulty being firm, tends to give workers too much
leeway. As mate, NF has a deep need to give & receive affection and avoid 
conflict. As a teacher, NF makes each student feel important & cared about.
Desire to please & comfortable with theory makes NF an excellent student.
