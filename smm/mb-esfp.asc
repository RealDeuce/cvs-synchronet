ESFPs in short:

Outgoing, easygoing, accepting, friendly, enjoy everything and make
things more fun others by their enjoyment.  Like sports and making
things.  Know what's going and join in eagerly.  Find remembering
facts easier than mastering theories.  Are best in situations that
need sound common sense and practical ability with people as well
as with things.

About 13% of the population.

Details about ESFPs:

ESFPs radiate attractive warmth and optimism.  Smooth, witty,
charming, clever, voluble, and open to the environment - this
describes ESFPs who, like ESTPs, represent about 13 percent of the
general population.  They are great fun to be with and are the most
generous of all the types.  'Performer' would be the word which
best describes an ESFP.

ESFPs will avoid being alone and seek the company of others
whenever possible.  ESFPs easily find company, for others are
usually highly entertained by the presence of an ESFP.  ESFPs love
excitement and create it wherever they are.  Their joy of living is
contagious and generally they wear happy faces.  Often outstanding
conversationalists, their flowing banter is amusing in its wit.

ESFPs have an air of sophistication and are likely to be dressed in
the latest fashion, displaying an enjoyment of all the good things
of life: dress, food, physical comfort, and happy times.  ESFPs
create a mood of "eat, drink, and be merry" wherever they go, and
around them life can have a continual party-like atmosphere of
gaiety.

ESFPs make exciting, if somewhat unpredictable mates, which may
give quieter type mates some anxiety and tension from living on the
edge of adventure.  The home of an ESFP is likely to be filled with
people all having a good time.  Problems will not be allowed to
make their appearance.  The ESFP accomplishes this by taking an
attitude of "walking by the graveyard whistling," refusing to
recognize doom and gloom.

ESFPs can be generous to a fault.  What is theirs is yours, and
what is yours is yours still.  They give assistance to one and all
without expectation of a return, just as they love freely without
expecting something in return.  ESFPs seem to view life as an
eternal cornucopia from which flows an endless supply of pleasures
that require no effort on their part to insure.

ESFPs' talent for enjoying life can make them more subject to
temptations than are other types.  They are inclined to be
impulsive, and thus both male and female ESFPs are vulnerable to
psychological seduction, if not physical seduction, with an ESFP
giving in easily and agreeably to the demands of others.  As a
parent, the ESFP will be entertaining, a friend, and a source of
fun and excitement.  When there is sickness, or trouble, however,
ESFPs may become impatient and may want to absent themselves.

ESFPs' tolerance for anxiety is the lowest of all types.  Anxiety
is avoided by ignoring the dark side of a situation as long as
possible.  They are inclined to be somewhat self-indulgent, but,
rather than make an outward show of resistance or make waves, ESFPs
will give apparent compliance - and then go their own way to what
they enjoy.

ESFPs prefer active jobs and should not be given lonely, solitary
assignments.  Outstanding in public relations, they love working
with people.  Decisions are made with personal warmth, based on
personal reference or reference to significant others.  This type
relies on their personal experiences and generally show good common
sense.

The gregarious sociability and adaptability of ESFPs make them a
source of warmth to others.  They do not mind telephone or personal
interruptions and are verbally facile in both situations.  They can
be counted on to have accurate data about the people around them,
gaining these data through effortless and continuous observations.

ESFPs are not deeply interested in scholastic pursuits, wanting
knowledge only for immediate utility.  They avoid science and
engineering, gravitate toward business, and are adept at selling,
particularly selling tangibles.

They can be effective in education, especially elementary school
teaching, and can enjoy nursing for its drama.  They are good at
working with people in crisis, a facility, which often leads ESFPs
into social work.  They also enjoy entertaining people and are thus
drawn to the performing arts, thriving on the excitement of being
in the limelight.
