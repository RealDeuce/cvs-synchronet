ENTJs in short:

Hearty, frank, decisive, leaders in activities.  Usually good in
anything that requires reasoning and intelligent talk, such as
public speaking.  Are usually well-informed and enjoy adding to
their fund of knowledge.  May sometimes be more positive and
confident than their experience in an area warrants.

About 5% of the population.

Details about ENTJs:

If one word were used to capture ENTJ's style, it would be
commandant.  The basic driving force and need of ENTJs is to lead,
and from an early age they can be observed taking over groups. This
type is found in approximately 5 percent of the total population.

ENTJs have a strong urge to give structure wherever they are - to
harness people to distant goals.  Their empirical, objective, and
extroverted thinking may be highly developed; if this is the case,
they use classification, generalization, summarization, adduction
of evidence, and demonstration with ease.

They resemble ESTJs in their tendency to establish plans for a
task, enterprise, or organization, but ENTJs search more for policy
and goals than for regulations and procedures.

An ENTJ's introverted thinking (analysis and conservation) may be
less well developed than the extroverted thinking processes, and
the ENTJ leader may turn to an ENTP or INTP to provide this kind of
input.  ENTJs are similar to INTJs except that the former places
greater trust in empirical thought than in intuition; it is the
ENTJs own intuitive sense of coherence, however, that augments and
supports their empirical thinking.

Although ENTJs are tolerant of established procedures, they can
abandon any procedure when it can be shown to be indifferent to the
goal it seemingly serves.  Inefficiency is especially rejected by
ENTJs, and repetition of error causes them to become impatient. For
the ENTJ, there must always be a reason for doing anything, and
people's feelings usually are not sufficient reason.

When in charge of an organization, ENTJs more than any other type
desire (and generally have the ability) to visualize where the
organization is going and seem able to communicate that vision to
others.  They are the natural organization builders, and they
cannot not lead.  They find themselves in command and sometimes are
mystified as to how this happened.

As administrators, ENTJs organize their units into a smooth
functioning system, planning in advance, keeping both short-term
and long-range objectives well in mind.  They seek and can see
efficiency and effectiveness in personnel.  They prefer decisions
to be based on impersonal data, want to work from well-thought-out
plans, and like to use engineered operations - and they prefer that
others follow suit.  ENTJs will support the policy of the
organization and will expect others to do so.

ENTJs will usually rise to positions of responsibility and enjoy
being executives.  They are tireless in their devotion to their
jobs and can easily block out other areas of life for the sake of
work.  They will be able to reduce inefficiency, ineffectiveness,
and aimless confusion, being willing to dismiss employees who
perpetuate such behaviors.

ENTJs tend to work in organizational structures of some sort, tend
to be in charge administratively, and rise to top levels of
responsibility, whether in the military, business, education, or
government.

ENTJs take charge of the home.  When the ENTJ is present, there
will be little doubt as to who is in command.  Because their work
is so important to them, however, they can become increasingly
absent, especially if male.

Male or female, ENTJs expect a great deal of their mates, who need
to possess a strong personality of their own, a well-developed
autonomy, many and varied interests, and a healthy self-esteem.  A
career wife, however, may not be appealing to an ENTJ male, who is
apt to view his home and family as a part of his professional
background, a resource, and adjunct to his own career development.

As a parent, an ENTJ will be thoroughly in charge, and the children
will know what is expected of them - and will be expected to obey.
When this does not occur, an ENTJ parent is not apt to make a
scene; rather, there is likely to be a low-key, firm issuance of
reprimand and a taking-for-granted of immediate obedience.

While both mating and parenting are roles of importance to the
ENTJ, they are to some degree preempted by the ENTJ's strong career
interest.  The romantic dream and the quest for the ideal mate is
usually not a characteristic of this type.

ENTJs generally do, however, expect a home to be attractive,
well-ordered, with meals served punctually and maintenance
accomplished on schedule - all these in the service of the larger
goal of creating a family system where children can be reared to be
productive and healthy and establishing a devoted, harmonious
relationship between man and woman.

An ENTJ male might expect his mate to be active in civic and
community affairs, to be socially sophisticated, and to be as
well-educated as he.  The ENTJ female may find it difficult to
select a mate who is not overwhelmed by her strong personality and
will.
