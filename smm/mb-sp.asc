The SP must be free & will not be tied down with responsibility. Eat, drink &
be merry, for tomorrow we die. In Aesop's fable of the ant & the grasshopper,
the SP is the grasshopper. SP has the urge for impulsive action-for-right-now 
rather than practicing for some future event. Waiting is the same as death.
Likes diversity & trying new things. Easy come easy go. Not goal oriented.
Yet the SP shows long endurance; He wouldn't climb a mountain to get to the
top, but for the thrill of every moment. Gravitates toward jobs where action
is involved. Tends to be fraternal & loyal to his equals. Master of the grand
gesture, but not of the small important acts or words. Capable of abruptly
abandoning his path & striking out in a completely different direction.
Optimistic, libertarian, social equality. Compulsion to perform.
SP strengths are practicality, adept problem solving skills, resourcefulness.
As manager, SP is excellent in a crisis - and is not above creating a crisis
to give him a sense of purpose. As mate, enjoys intensity & a thrill a minute.
As teachers, are best at practical-vocational, tend to shy away from 
theoretical or abstract. Not good at lesson plans. Dealing with money, SP is
the original high roller. Not good at academics, poor spellers, least likely
of all the types to receive a college degree.
