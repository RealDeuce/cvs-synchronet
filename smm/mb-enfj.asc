Details about ENFJs:

ENFJs are outstanding leaders of groups, both task groups and
growth groups.  They have the charming characteristic of seeming to
take for granted that they will be followed, never doubting that
people will want to do what they suggest.  And, more often than
not, people do, because this type of has unusual charisma.  ENFJs
place a high value on cooperation from others and are most willing
to cooperate themselves.

Found in only about 5 percent of the general population, ENFJs
place people as being of highest importance and priority.  As a
result, ENFJs may find themselves feeling responsible for the
feelings of others to an extent which places a burden on the
relationship.

An ENFJ communicates caring, concern, and a willingness to be
involved.  Thus people turn to ENFJs for nurture and support, which
an ENFJ is usually able to deliver.  At times, however, these kinds
of demands can overwhelm ENFJs, who find at this point that they
lack the skills to dissociate.  ENFJs do not seem able to turn away
from these demands even when they become unreasonable.  Or, if
forced to let go of the burden through sheer unavailability of time
or energy, ENFJs experience a guilt all out of proportion to the
realities of the commitment to the relationship.

ENFJs are vulnerable to idealize interpersonal relationships,
raising these relationships to a plane which seldom can sustain the
realities of human nature.  Because of this tendency to raise
interpersonal relations to the ideal, ENFJs may unwittingly
overpower their friends, who believe that they cannot possibly live
up to an ENFJ's perception of them.  The fact is, ENFJs are
extraordinarily tolerant of others, seldom critical, and always
trustworthy.

ENFJs take communication for granted and believe that they are
understood and that their communications are accepted.  Just as
they themselves are accepting, so do they assume that others are
the same.  When ENFJs find that their position or beliefs were not
comprehended or accepted, they are surprised, puzzled, and
sometimes hurt.  Fortunately, this does not happen with high
frequency, as ENFJs have a remarkable fluency with language,
especially in speech; they are particularly adept when
communicating face-to-face as opposed to communicating in writing.

They are influential, therefore, in groups, having no hesitation
about speaking out, no matter how large or small the group may be.

ENFJs have an unusual ability to relate to others with empathy,
taking into themselves the characteristics, emotions, and beliefs
of others.  This can pose a danger for ENFJs, they can
unconsciously over-identify with others and pick up their burdens
as if they were their own.  In the process, ENFJs may risk their
own sense of identity.

They have a natural ability to mimic because of this highly
developed ability to empathize by interjection.  They are likely to
be very concerned about the problems of those close to them, but
they also may get as deeply involved in the problems of those not
so close and may find themselves overextended emotionally.

ENFJs would do well to follow their hunches, for their intuition
tends to be well developed.  Decisions made purely on the basis of
logic may not be so sound, and checking with a person who has a
strong T preference might be at times advisable for the ENFJ.  In
the framework of values, however, the ENFJ is on certain ground.
Generally, they know what they prefer and can read other people
with outstanding accuracy.  Seldom is an ENFJ wrong about the
motivations or intents of another, hidden or not.

ENFJs are socially adept and make excellent companions and mates.
They also are deeply devoted to their children, yet tend not to be
domineering to either the children or a mate.  In fact, the ENFJ is
so even-tempered that he or she can be victimized by a mate who
might have become more than demanding.

ENFJ mates always try to please and feel personally responsible
when home life does not go smoothly.  They are tireless in their
efforts to see that it does, providing generously from available
income, time and energy.  This dedication often exists, however,
side by side with an ENFJ's dream of the perfect relationship - a
characteristic of all NFs, but one which is particularly strong in
an ENFJ.  Thus an ENFJ has that longing for the ideal which results
in a vague dissatisfaction with whatever is in the way of
relationships, mating as well as friendship.

This longing for the perfect carries over into the careers of
ENFJs, who experience some degree of restlessness whatever their
jobs.  And, as with ENFPs, ENFJs have a wide range of occupations
which offer success.

Being verbally adept, ENFJs contribute to an unusual level when
dealing with people, particularly face-to-face: the media, the
ministry, and the stage and screen are populated with successful
ENFJs.  They make superior therapists, charismatic teachers,
excellent executives, and personalized executives.  Areas that
would not permit utilization of the interaction talents of the
ENFJs, for example, accounting, should be avoided; otherwise,
almost any people-to-people occupation where personal, sustained
contact is involved capitalizes on the personality of an ENFJ.

ENFJs like to have things organized and settled.  They prefer to
plan both work and social engagements ahead and tend to be
absolutely reliable in honoring these commitments.  ENFJs are very
much at home in complex situations which require the juggling of
much data.  At the same time they can handle people with charm and
concern.

ENFJs are usually popular wherever they are.  Their ability to be
comfortable either leading or following makes them easy to have
around, whatever the situation.  A well-developed ENFJ group leader
can provide, almost endlessly, activities for groups to play.  In
some, this can amount to genius which other types find hard to
emulate.  In this ability to organize without planning there is a
certain, similarity to the ESFJ, but the latter acts more as a
master of ceremonies than as a leader of groups.  The ESFJ is more
of a recreational leader, who insures that each member has fun at a
party and that the right things are expressed at social occasions,
especially institutional social occasions such as weddings,
funerals, parties, and the like.

ENFJs, just like ESFJs, value harmonious human relations above all
else; but ENFJs are not so easily crushed by indifference as are
ESFJs and are more independent of others' valuations.
