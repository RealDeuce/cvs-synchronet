CTerm terminal chariteristics:
------------------------------

Control characters:

CR:
	Move cursor position to column 1 of the current line

LF:
	Move cursor position to same row of the next column.
	If current row is the last row, scrolls the screen up
	and fills the new row with the current attribute.

BS:
	Non-destructive backspace.  Moves cursor position to
	the previous column unless the current column is the
	first, in which case no operation is performed.

0x07:
	Beep

TAB:
	Moves to the next tab stop.  Does not overwrite any
	characters in between.  If the starting position is
	last column, advances to next line.  If starting
	position is the last column of the last line, performs
	a scroll, filling the new line at bottom with the
	current attribute and moves to the first character in
	the new line.

Control Codes:
--------------

Control codes are in the following format:
ESC {SPACE to '/'}{'0' (ZERO) to '~'}
	There may be multiple characters from the {SPACE to '/'} set
	before the terminating '0' to '~'

	Legal combinations which are not handled are silently dropped.

ESC D
	Scrolls window up one line filling the bottom line with the
	current attribute.
	SOURCE: BANSI.TXT

ESC M
	Scrolls window down one line filling the top line with the
	current attribute
	SOURCE: BANSI.TXT

Control Sequences:
------------------

Control sequences start with the Control Sequence Introducer which is
ESC [  CSI will be used to express this from now on.

Control sequences are in the following format:
CSI {'0' (ZERO) to '?'}{SPACE to '/'}{'@' to '~'}
	There may be multiple characters from the {'0' (ZERO) to '?'}
	and {SPACE to '/'} before the terminating {'@' to '~'} character.

	Legal combinations not handled are silently dropped.
	Illegal combinations are displayed.

Sequence Parameters:
	Parameters are expressed by the {'0' (ZERO) to '?'} character set.
	Sequences which use parameters use decimal parameters separated by
	a ';'.  The use of a ':' from the set is reserver.
	If the parameter string begins with '<', '=', '>', or '?' then
	this is a non-standard extension to the ANSI spec.

	Parameters will be shown as pX where X will be a decimal position
	number.  Surrounded by [] indicates the parameter is optional.

CSI = [p1] M
	NON-STANDARD EXTENSION.
	Defaults:  p1 = 0
	Sets the current state of ANSI music parsing.
	0 - Only CSI | will introduce an ANSI music string.
	1 - Both CSI | and CSI N will introduce an ANSI music string.
	2 - CSI |, CSI N, and CSI M will all intriduce and ANSI music string.
	    In this mode, Delete Line will not be available.

	SOURCE: CTerm only.

CSI [ p1 [ ; p2 ] ] * r
	NON-STANDARD EXTENSION.
	Set the output emulation speed.
	If p1 or p2 are omitted, causes output speed emulation to stop
	p1 may be empty.
	Sequence is ignored if p1 is not empty, 0, or 1.
	The value of p2 sets the output speed emulation as follows:

	Value		Speed
	-----		-----
	empty, 0	Unlimited
	1		300
	2		600
	3		1200
	4		2400
	5		4800
	6		9600
	7		19200
	8		38400
	9		57600
	10		76800
	11		115200
