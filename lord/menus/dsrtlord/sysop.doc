
                        Installation For Desert LORD




Hi There, and thanx for deciding to try out Desert LORD.
Installation couldn't be much easier.

Installation Steps:

1. Move your old LORDTXT.DAT and LENEMY.DAT files 
   to a separate directory.

2. Move the new LORDTXT.DAT and LENEMY.DAT files 
   to your LORD directory.

3. Play LORD!

And you're done. Easy huh?

I'll be working on some new LORD add-ons in the near future,
so keep your eyes peeled for `em.
Should you care to call up my BBS and take a look around the
