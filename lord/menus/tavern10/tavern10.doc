Well, Someone had to do it,heh? As many LORDTXT.DAT's are going around I'd
Figure a LNETTXT.DAT would be nice.. and different.

1- Backup or Rename your old LNETTXT.DAT.

2-Copy Tavern10.dat to you LORDNET Directory as Lnettxt.dat

3-Thank J.Master's for writing this.

4-Do the wild chicken dance.

Later,

OH YEAH, One more thing if for some reason you have alot of menus for 
LORDNET, then you can randomize them by using RANDLOOK.EXE. I know
this is for LORDTXT.DAT's but just rename the file to LNETTXT.DAT!
Yes,it thats simple. You'll need to make a batch file to run this..
but take my advice if you only have 2 don't do this because it rarely
picks the second one. 

<E>xample

LORDTXT.1 ---> Regular Menus. (put these in your lordnet dir.)
LORDTXT.2 ---> My Menus. =]

-Here's my Batch file.-

@ECHO OFF
CD\DOORS\LORDNET
RANDLOOK 2
COPY LORDTXT.DAT LNETTXT.DAT
CD\DOORS\LORD
C:\DOORS\LORDNET\LORDNET.EXE DOOR C:\DOORS\LORDNET *

oH-Well... Thats it! Hope you have fun.
