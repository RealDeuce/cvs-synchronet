  `%O'Brien:
  `0So, Julian.  What do you say to a game of raquetball?
  `%Bashir:
  `0Haha!  I can't take another game with you, Chief.
  `%Dax:
  `0Although I'd like to take you on.
  `%O'Brien:
  `0Are you sure about that?  Okay.  If you really want to.
  `%Bashir:
  `0Watch out, chief - she has a mean bite!
  `%O'Brien:
  `0Oh, sure - I'll keep a real good eye out!
  `%Quark:
  `0Gentlemen!  Dax!  Can I interest you in another drink?
