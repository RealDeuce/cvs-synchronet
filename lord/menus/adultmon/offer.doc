  Now, how many of you have thought about making your own Enemies for LORD?
  Quite a few of you, heh? Well, out of all of you who have - how many of
  you just haven't had the time to do so? That's what I thought. I do
  understand that it is a time consuming process that just seems to drag on
  and on. Those dreaded names, weapons, and death phrases you have to come 
  up with just seem to elude you. God knows I've been there myself. So here
  is my offer to you who just don't have the time to edit those enemies your-
  selves.

  I will create Lenemy.Dat files for you. You can either leave everything
  up to me, or you can tell me what you basically want to see -- such as:
  Political, fairy tale, horor, x-rated, silly, etc. enemies. I will
  create a minimum of 10 enemies per level, more if you like. And I will do
  all of this for a small $3 a file. The $3 covers my time, and any mailing
  charges (which includes long distance calls for uploading the files).
  Or, if you prefer, I can mail you a low-density floppy with 5 random .dat
  files for just $6.

  If you are intirested just mail me a letter telling my what you want with
  a check or money order for each file, or for each disk. It's as simple as
  that. You will receive your files within 2 weeks, barring mailing delays.
