Overview:


     If you are like me and hate to hit that enter key more than needed,
     then this is the lordtxt.dat file you need. You know when you go to buy
     Armor or Weapons and on the Buy Screen, you have to hit the enter key
     befor you can enter your selection, This one fixes that. Just replace
     the old lordtxt.dat with this one.
 
          (Always make a backup of the original so you can replace it)

                             (if somthing screws up!)
