                           Welcome to Celtic Lord.

        I have put a lot of time and effort in this add on enhancer.
So appreciate it.  This is not the best but not bad for the first time.
Excpect some IGM's in the future.  I am bound to get better.  Guess what
this is *FREE*.  I don't want your money.  I already got money.  Hell I
was born with money so I why would I need your's.  As for the Upcoming
IGM's well they will be free too.  I know you guy's don't register them
anyway.  I know I am a Sysop. But I will have mine registered.

                           How to get started.

type install "your lord directory" ie c:\lord
to uninstall type uninstal in your lords directory
Now isn't that simple.  Have fun
