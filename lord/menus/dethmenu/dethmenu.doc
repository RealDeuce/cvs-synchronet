Welcome to a whole new menu set for Seth Able's Legend Of the Red Dragon.
Installation is easy. Just text edit the dethinst.bat and nodeth.bat files
and set the paths to your LORD path. Then run the dethinst.bat file. It will
replace your lordtxt.dat file with my lordtxt.dat. To get rid of it run 
nodeth.bat. That's it! Oh, and by the way, this is freeware, because noone
would pay for this lousy thing. And if this screws anything up in any way,
you agree to not hold me responsible. Until we meet again,
