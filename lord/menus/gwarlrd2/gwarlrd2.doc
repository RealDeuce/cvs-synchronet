        I do not accept any responsibility if this doesn't work.  So don't
come crying to me, bitching about how this screwed up your system.  It
should work though, so don't be afraid to run it.  

        I wrote this because I was tired of all the other LORDTXT.DAT's that
were going around.  All you need to do to run it is unzip in your LORD
directory and overwrite your old LORDTXT.DAT file.  Copy your old LORDTXT.DAT
in case you would rather use it instead of this, although I don't know why
you would want to use any other LORDTXT.DAT!

        This LORDTXT.DAT has some of your favorite characters like Charlie
Manson, Sleazy P. Martini, and even the dreaded GOR GOR.
        
        This is an upgrade of GWARLORD.ZIP, which has a couple of spelling
errors fixed, and has a scarier look to the colors. (OOH!)

        The number for my BBS is at the top of this file.  Just leave E-Mail
to Whitfield. (that's me!)  Features a great Legend of the Red Dragon with
God knows how many IGM's.
