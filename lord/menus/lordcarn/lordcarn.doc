Story:

=============================================================================
The Red Dragon has been growing bolder...Attacking the town night after night, 
carrying away the damsels, or warriors -dependant upon it's mood - that it
desires. The townsfolk who were able have left. Those either to helpless, 
hapless, poor, or stupid have remained. This tragedy has attracted others
like you. Those who have grown bored with the quite life in the city, and 
come to the country in search of excitment! Not to mention the fame and 
wealth that goes along with success. You dream only of success....how can 
you dream of anything else, despite the bodies piling up around you.

    The author of lordcarn has taken every precaution to insure that no
    harm or damage will occur on computer systems operating the lordcarn
    add-on package. Actually, its practically impossible for this program
    to do any harm since its just plain TEXT files! But, since this is
    a free copy, there will probably be some bugs in it! If you encounter
    any bugs or problems, please call my BBS and leave me a message
    which explains the problem. If in any way, for any reason, or even without
    reason this causes any damages to any hardware/software, I take no 
    responsibity. But dont worry! Its improbable that anything will go wrong!

                          *** 1. About lordcarn ***
        Well, after writing Morn Lord, I decided to round out the day.
        I have add ons for afternoon - ShadLORD and now evening.
        I also have the mystlord add on, which I feel is by far the best.
        it hints at things in the background, ties them all together, 
        to let your imagination run free, and fill in the whole picture.
        Now Lordcarn - Lord of Carnage adds the bodies of the dead to the
        entire picture. A grim, yet more realistic add on.

                      *** 2. Installation Instructions ***

   Installing lordcarn should be a simple process since all it does is
   it renames your current lordtxt.dat files to
   lordtxt.old.


-=-=Batch Installation=-=-

To use the batch files for installation simply extract the
contents of the zip file to any directory (you probably already
did that!) Run the file INSTALL.BAT with a parameter of where
your LORD is installed.

*Example*
INSTALL.BAT C:\LORD

Its that easy! To Uninstall simply move to your LORD directory
at the DOS prompt and type UNINSTAL.BAT (or UNINSTAL).
But please note, if you haven't already installed lordcarn before
running this file, you will lose a few files LORD needs to run!


** If for some reason you did run the Uninstall program first, here
** is how you fix it...

** You must have your original Lord zip file to fix this problem!
** Inside of the lord.zip file you will find the two files that you
** are missing. Look for lordtxt.dat. Ok, extract or
** move them to your lord directory and its all fixed up!
** Of course, who is dumb enough to run the uninstall program first? =)


-=-=Manual Installation=-=-

If for some reason you need to do a manual installation here is how...
Go to your LORD directory and rename the following files...

lordtxt.dat  to  lordtxt.old

Now,   rename Lordtext.bod  to  lordtxt.dat

Ok, now move both of them files to your LORD directory and its all
set up!


                             *** 3. Updates ***

If you would like to recieve updates of this program, see 6. Registering 
LordCarn later in this file...

                            *** 4. Questions ***

--= I thought this program was FREEWARE, why would I register it? =--

** Yes, this program is FREEWARE, you dont have to send me a cent **
** to use it! But I took a lot of my time to write this program   **
** so you and your callers could enjoy it! If everyone would send **
** me some spare change, it would make me want to add more and    **
** more to my program, and possibly write more programs.          **
** Like I said earlier, I WILL add more if a few people register! **
** At least send me a note telling me what you like, don't like,  **
** Would like to see in the future, etc..                         **


--= What do I get if I register? =--

** Well, the main thing you get is knowing that you helped another **
** person out by making his hard spent time worth something!       **
** But, thats probably not enough, so you also get all newer       **
** versions, by E-Mail, and you will get added to my mailing list  **
** for all new programs I write in the future. (Shareware, or      **
** FREEWARE only! I cant give you ALL my registered programs!)     **


--= Where do I send my registration money? =--

** See chapter 6 for more information on registering **

                     ***** 6. Registration Info *****

Not really a registration, so much as a pat on the back, the old chunk on the 
shoulder, the ole school yell. That sorta thing. Send me what you think the 
program you have is worth. I will look at what you sent, decide upon it's 
value, and return what i feel you deserve. For instance, $5 might be worth
all the addons I have written, so far. A good idea for a new add on, might
get it sent to you complete. Get the idea? We'll see.
