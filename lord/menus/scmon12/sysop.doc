    your main LORD directory
3.  Copy the lenemy.dat contained in this archive to your main LORD
    directory!

**Important!
Do not modify these monsters with the built in Monster Editor 
for LORD v4.xx (lordcfg.exe) It can not handle the length of
monster names etc with our color modifications!  See the FAQ below
on a program that can edit our monsters!

Legal stuff:

This is free open source software, there are no guarantee that it will do
anything more than take up space on your hard drive.  You may modify the
monsters to suite your needs but you may not modify this document or any
other associated documents contained in this distribution.

FAQ:

How is this monster set different from Seth's Default set or any other
monster set?

There are new monsters with wonderful colors and changed levels of strength,
defense, experience, and gold awarded.  Their death phrazes have also been
colorized and changed.  Basically it is nothing like Seth's default monster
set!

How did you create these monsters?

Level's 9-12 were first created using TC Software's LORD Monster Expansion.
These levels were then modified further and the rest of the levels in the 
monster set completed using Doug Blatherwick's Monster Editor version 2.51 (lordmon.exe)
This is a great monster editor and is the only thing I know 100% will edit
this monster set!  It is available at www.bobobbs.net/scmon/

How can I get support!?

Simply visit www.bobobbs.net to logon to the first BBS to feature this
monster set! or email sysop@bobobbs.net and discribe to me the problem!
