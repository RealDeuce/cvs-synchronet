=============================================================================
 
Oh what a beautiful morning. Oh what a beautiful DAY! You awake once
more in the realm. For some reason you have yet to fathom, you are in 
a great mood! You whistle a jaunty tune and head into the streets.

Everyone is talking about the piles of knawed and burned bones, found
outside the village gates. You make many humorus, yet unsavory jokes 
about them. Your mood, is so contagious, soon you and the gossips are
laughing uproariously over the find. Still chuckling you move on.
 
Everyone you meet seems to pick up your good humor. You make you plans
to hunt through the forrest, in search of more entertainment.

    The author of Mornlord has taken every precaution to insure that no
    harm or damage will occur on computer systems operating the Mornlord
    add-on package. Actually, its practically impossible for this program
    to do any harm since its just plain TEXT files! But, since this is
    a free copy, there will probably be some bugs in it! If you encounter
    any bugs or problems, please call my BBS and leave me a message
    which explains the problem. If in any way, for any reason, or even without
    reason this causes any damages to any hardware/software, I take no

                          *** 1. About Mornlord ***

   After playing LORD (Legend Of the Red Dragon), for about a year, I began
   to note that all of the addons were of a single mind set. GRIM. (or very
   risque!!) I decided to create a number of free addons, which convey different
   moods, and times of the day. From morning/cheery, to afternnon/sober, to
   Evening/Rowdy.
   I hope to instill a little humor into these and future add ons.
   
                      *** 2. Installation Instructions ***

   Installing Mornlord should be a simple process since all it does is
   it renames your current lordtxt.dat files to
   lordtxt.old.


-=-=Batch Installation=-=-

To use the batch files for installation simply extract the
contents of the zip file to any directory (you probably already
did that!) Run the file INSTALL.BAT with a parameter of where
your LORD is installed.

*Example*
INSTALL.BAT C:\LORD

Its that easy! To Uninstall simply move to your LORD directory
at the DOS prompt and type UNINSTAL.BAT (or UNINSTAL).
But please note, if you haven't already installed Mornlord before
running this file, you will lose a few files LORD needs to run!


** If for some reason you did run the Uninstall program first, here
** is how you fix it...

** You must have your original Lord zip file to fix this problem!
** Inside of the lord.zip file you will find the two files that you
** are missing. Look for lordtxt.dat. Ok, extract or
** move them to your lord directory and its all fixed up!
** Of course, who is dumb enough to run the uninstall program first? =)


-=-=Manual Installation=-=-

If for some reason you need to do a manual installation here is how...
Go to your LORD directory and rename the following files...

lordtxt.dat  to  lordtxt.old

Now,   rename mtext.dat  to  lordtxt.dat

Ok, now move both of them files to your LORD directory and its all
set up!


                             *** 3. Updates ***

If you would like to recieve updates of this program, see 6. Registering 
MornLord later in this file...

                            *** 4. Questions ***

--= I thought this program was FREEWARE, why would I register it? =--

** Yes, this program is FREEWARE, you dont have to send me a cent **
** to use it! But I took a lot of my time to write this program   **
** so you and your callers could enjoy it! If everyone would send **
** me some spare change, it would make me want to add more and    **
** more to my program, and possibly write more programs.          **
** Like I said earlier, I WILL add more if a few people register! **
** At least send me a note telling me what you like, don't like,  **
** Would like to see in the future, etc..                         **


--= What do I get if I register? =--

** Well, the main thing you get is knowing that you helped another **
** person out by making his hard spent time worth something!       **
** But, thats probably not enough, so you also get all newer       **
** versions, by E-Mail, and you will get added to my mailing list  **
** for all new programs I write in the future. (Shareware, or      **
** FREEWARE only! I cant give you ALL my registered programs!)     **


--= Where do I send my registration money? =--

** See chapter 6 for more information on registering **
