
Ahh yes, another Eyeball, Inc. Production.....

EXPERT LORD
~~~~~~~~~~~
Another Lordtxt.dat replacement by Eyeball

Are you tired of all them Lord's with the snazzy ansi's and extreme graphx
that make you wanna just QUIT the game?  Well, if you're like me and wanna 
get thru the game in less than 5 minutes (cuz you're an expert) then I 
suggest you try this.  Even in Lord's default expert mode there are still
menus that are displayed (like that annoying Healer's Hut menu).  Well, this
prog (err, file) gets rid of that..

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ok, if you don't know how to install this and are too lazy and need an 
installation prog (like some other lordtxt.dat's that I know) then all ya
do is move the lordtxt.dat included with this zipfile to your lord dir and 
WA'LA (I'm not french so shuddup) you're done.  

TIP
~~~
Ok, if you got some novice Lord players on your board (assuming you got one)
then I suggest don't use this, unless on your doors menu you can put "Expert
LORD" or "LORD for Experts" or somethin...just make sure they know how to
play lord and don't enter the game and hang up when they don't know what
the hell to do.  

ETC.
~~~~
Special super-duper thanx to the Almighty Seth Able-Robinson for making 
LORD what it is today (and for continuing in the future..)

Regular special thanx to Eyeball for makin this file and supplying the 
ultra-cool File_id.diz for all you lazy sops out there..

Old boring thanx to all my Lord players on my board, Eye's Place..cuz they
deserve to play the best!

SHAMELESS PLUG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Call my bbs: 713/446/2496 down here in Houston Tx (chances are this won't 
even get outta houston so why bother?)
I got Lord files comin outta my mouth...and even other crevices...(g)
By the time you read this I should have bout 200 lord files..hell even 
d/l a pic of Seth Able himself!

AND REMEMBER:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This AIn't shareware so if you don't like it shut the hell up!
