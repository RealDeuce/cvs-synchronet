BARNLORD v1.0

The first and final version...

Ok, teen freaks (probably the only people who will download this), here's
something that caters to every adolescent BBSer (the people who never pay,
eh?)

I wrote this in about 5 minutes over the phone with a friend, so, get your
opinions from that.  It's definitely no worse than any other LORDTXT.DAT
replacement, this one doesn't attempt to "CHANGE THE THEME OF THE GAME",
something I think is insane when one can only change a partial menuset...
However, one can change the places and the person one is attacking, so that's
what I did...  Legend of the Purple Antichrist, if you will.

Oh, and about those really weird people who want you to "REGISTER" these 
things, ummm.... Let's just say I find them all very wrapped up in their own
talent, OK?  

Oh, if you kinda like the idea, but don't like the way it was executed, feel
150% free to modify it, whatever, release it as version 1.5 or something,
just add on to this DOC or whatever, but please thank me somewhere (my only
consolation!)
