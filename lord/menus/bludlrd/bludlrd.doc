WARNING: THIS PROGRAM IS NOT FOR THE [EXTREMELY] WEAK AT HEART...[although if
you've seen a good horror movie without puking then you pretty much stand a 
chance at living through it]

Just a little warning to make sure I'm not totally responsible for anything
that happens if a player decides to upchuck at any point..


BLOOD LORD v1.0 : LORDTXT.DAT replacement file for Legend Of The Red Dragon 
v3.26 (c)

What is Blood LORD??
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is merely a different way to play Lord...all it basically is is changes
to the text on the lordtxt.dat file, such as making the hot-key color red,
etc.  Nothing more, really.

Archive includes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BLUDLRD.DOC : The textfile you're reading right now.
LORDTXT.DAT : The file you move to your main LORD directory to put the
              program in effect.
FILE_ID.DIZ : File Description.  (For all you lazy Sysops..:))

Installation: (IOW, lordtxt.dat replacement prog installation made easy)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First of all, it's up to you, if you feel for some strange reason that Blood
LORD won't work, you can rename your original LORDTXT.DAT to LORDTXT.BAK or 
something to back it up just in case something goes wrong (which is RARE when
it comes to replacement lordtxt.dat progs)
Ok, unarchive BLUDLRD.ZIP/ARJ/whatever into a directory of your choice. (If 
you don't want to back up your original Lordtxt.dat, then put it all in your
LORD dir for easy installation.) Move the LORDTXT.DAT file to your main LORD
directory (ex. C:\BBS\LORD). If you haven't backed it up chances are it'll
ask you to overwrite the existing file..just say yes.  That's it! 
ENJOY!!!

Registration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Because I feel that NO program that replaces Lordtxt/lenemy.dats requires 
registration, I won't bug you all the way to hell and back just to register.
After all, all it is is a FILE!!!! (If only all the others would think about
that!) Ok, so this program's freeware...FREE FREE FREE!! (Love that word 
while it still exists!)
