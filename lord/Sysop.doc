LORD - A JavaScript rewrite of the classic Legend of the Red Dragon.

This door is intended to be a rewrite of the classic LORD in JavaScript.  For
Synchronet systems, this means it can be ran without a separate process, but
with JSDOOR, it can also run under other BBS software.

For Synchronet BBSs, setup is straightforward:

[LORD]
 1: Name                       LORD 5.00 JS
 2: Internal Code              LORD
 3: Start-up Directory         /sbbs/xtrn/lord
 4: Command Line               ?lord.js
 5: Clean-up Command Line      
 6: Execution Cost             None
 7: Access Requirements        
 8: Execution Requirements     
 9: Multiple Concurrent Users  Yes
10: Intercept I/O              No
11: Native Executable          No
12: Use Shell to Execute       No
13: Modify User Data           No
14: Execute on Event           No
15: Pause After Execution      No
16: BBS Drop File Type         None
17: Place Drop File In         Node Directory
18: Time Options...

For non-synchronet systems, socket and stdio are both supported.  door.sys
should be used with the socket handle passed on the command-line:

jsdoor lord.js -d /path/to/door.sys -s <handle>

LORD.js also has an IGM installer/uninstaller.  From the LORD directory, you
can run the script using jsexec or jsdoor with the following syntax:

jsexec lord.js +IGM path/to/igm.js

This will add the IGM to your other places automatically.  To remove the IGM,
use -IGM.

The game can be reset by passing the "reset" parameter:

jsexec lord.js RESET

LORD is configured via the lord.ini file.  The global section has the following
keys available.

InactivityDays=		15
The number of days after which to delete an inactive player.  A "day" is only
counted if at least one player enters the game.

Delete1XP=		true
If true, players with 1xp are deleted the next day.  Generally, players with
one XP simply entered the game then left, though it is possible to enter the
game, lose your first battle, and end with 1xp.

CleanMode=		false
When enabled, some adult themes are left out of the game.  Mostly this just
means sex.

DeedsToWin=		3
How many times the dragon must be slain for a player to be declared the winner.
After a winner is declared, the game must be reset (TODO: Auto-reset after
some period of time).

BankTransfersAllowed=	true
If this is true, players are allowed to send gold to each other.  This can
result in team play, which you may want to discourage.

BankTransfersPerDay=	2
The number of times a player can transfer funds in a day.  This value tends to
set the maximum team size.  If you want to allow team play, but only allow
small teams, a value of two is good.

MaxTransferAmount=	2000000
The maximum amount per bank transfer.  This allows another control over team
play.  The smaller this number is, the less impactful team play gets.

PlayerFightsPerDay=	3
Number of player fights per day.  Player fights are a huge source of experience
in the game, so if there's a large enough number of players, this helps keep
the time required to slay the dragon relatively long.

ForestFightsPerDay=	15
Number of forest fights a player gets per day by default.  This effictivly sets
how long it takes to slay the dragon as well as how long a days session takes
to play.

RessurectionDays=	3
Number of days a player will be ressurected from the dead after the last day he
plays.  This only impacts players who miss player days... this is most easily
explained using ann example.
Day 1: Player plays and is killed.
Day 2: Player is *not* ressurected, but stays dead.
Day 3: Player is ressurected and moved to the fields so anyone can kill him.
Day 4: Player is ressurected.
Day 5: Player is ressurected.
Day 6: Player is left as dead until deleted due to InactivityDays.

Since player fights are an important XP source, this basically keeps the XP
available in the game when someone misses a few days.  Since the player loses
10% of their XP every time they are killed, this also acts to limit the
punishment for missing more than X days.

OutOfTimeFile=
The path to a file that is displayed when the user runs out of BBS time during
the session.

SafeNode=		true
This helps to prevent players from being listed as on when they have
disconnected.  Whenever a player is on, a file is created using the node
number.  If that file exists for the current node when a player enters the
game, the player who was previously on that node is marked as offline.  This
should only have an impact when the game is crashing.

UseFancyMore=		true
If true, more prompts are erased after the player presses a key.  I can't think
of any reason you would turn this off, but it's been an option in LORD since
the fancy more prompt was added, so it's left for historical purposes.

NoNPCChatter=		false
If this is true, NPCs will not comment in the conversation in the inn.

Olivia=			true
This enables the Olivia events.

FunkyFlowers=		true
If true, players can use background, blinking, and clear screen codes in the
flowers.  This can mess up game screens, so was disabled in v4.00 of LORD.
Some people really like this ability though, so setting this to true allows
the codes, but ensures the colours are restore correctly afterward.

ShopLimit=		true
If this is true, weapons in the shop require a minimum strength, and armour
requires a minimum defence.  This help prevent "camping" where a player sits
at level one or two and collects experience and items rather than trying to
slay the dragon.

FiveSkillPoints=	false
Before version 4, Death Knight and Thief skill uses required five skill points
per use.  This was later changed to four skill points.  The change to four
makes Thief and Death Knight generally better than magic.

BonusDefForPlayerKill=	false
In later 4.x versions of LORD, players started getting extra defence points
every time they killed another player.  This counteracted ShopLimit as a
camping protection, and made a player who used all their player attacks each
day effectively unkillable in the forest.

BonusStrForPlayerKill=	false
As above, 4.x versions of LORD said that you got extra strength for each player
kill.  Players didn't *actually* get this bonus though.

GamePrefix=
A file/path prefix for game data files.  This allows multiple LORD games to
keep their data in the same directory without interferring with each other.
Generally you would use the -p option and a separate lord.ini for each game, so
this option is not really needed.

GameServer=		nix.synchro.net.57038
Connect to a shared player database.  This helps for systems which have a small
number of players.  Be aware however that the game server is *not fair*.
Each game that connects to the server is allowed to use any game settings and
set if IGMs, so some of the players may have thousands of forest fights per day
while others have the default of 15.  Further, the game is not winnable.

GameUser=		QWKID
User ID for the shared player database.

GamePassword=		QWKPASS
Password for the shared player database.

MenuDir=		
Directory to read "menu files" from.  These allow customizing LORDs look and
feel to a great degree.  You can find a number of these in the menus/
directory.

BeefUpForHeroes=        false
If this is true, all battles become more difficult the more times you have
slain the dragon.  This helps keep the game challenging, but can irritate some
players who prefer a fixed strategy.

OldStealAmounts=        true
In older versions of LORD, when thieves robbed the bank, they got large amounts
of gold.  In new versions, the amount of gold is not very significant and
likely not worth using a fairy for.  This restores the old amounts.

WakeUpDragon=		true
This setting, like ShopLimit helps prevent camping.  If this is true, a player
with more than 15 million XP, or any player of level 12 who is *alive* when
they enter the game for the first time in a day will be attacked by the dragon.

DeathKnightBoost=	false
When set, a Death Knight attack does 3.3 times the damage instead of 3 times.
This helps make the Death Knight skills worth getting because without this,
thief skills do the same amount of damage, are easier to train in, and thieves
can rob the bank and are immune to troll attacks in the forest.  Having the
Death Knight skills do more damage makes up for this weakness.

NewUglyStick=		false
The old versions of the pretty/ugly stick event had a one in three chance of
giving five charm and a 2 in three chance of taking one charm.  This was
changed in 4.x to a one in three chance of gaining one or two charm and a two
in three chance of losing one or two charm, resulting in a net loss over time
from the ugly stick rather than a net gain.

Tournament Settings:

LORD can also be ran in "tournament mode" which changes the winning conditions.
Instead of requiring a fixed number of dragon kills, the winning stat can be
something else, and the winner can be as soon as someone reaches a target
number, or the the highest number after a specific numer of days.  These
are set in the [Tournament] section of lord.ini.

Enabled=		false
Must be true to enable tournament mode.

Days=			0
Number of days to run the tournament for.  If set to zero, a winstat must be
set.

WinStat=		XP
The player who has the highest value in this stat at the end of the tournament
wins.  Supported values are: XP, DragonKills, PlayerKills, Level, and Lays.

The following set a required target value when Days=0.  *ALL* of these numbers
must be met for a winner to be declared.

Experience=		0
DragonKills=		0
PlayerKills=		0
Level=			0
Lays=			0
