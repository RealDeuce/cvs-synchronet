LORD - A JavaScript rewrite of the classic Legend of the Red Dragon.

This door is intended to be a rewrite of the classic LORD in JavaScript.  For
Synchronet systems, this means it can be ran without a separate process, but
with JSDOOR, it can also run under other BBS software.

For Synchronet BBSs, setup is straightforward:

[LORD]
 1: Name                       LORD 5.00 JS
 2: Internal Code              LORD
 3: Start-up Directory         /sbbs/xtrn/lord
 4: Command Line               ?lord.js
 5: Clean-up Command Line      
 6: Execution Cost             None
 7: Access Requirements        
 8: Execution Requirements     
 9: Multiple Concurrent Users  Yes
10: Intercept I/O              No
11: Native Executable          No
12: Use Shell to Execute       No
13: Modify User Data           No
14: Execute on Event           No
15: Pause After Execution      No
16: BBS Drop File Type         None
17: Place Drop File In         Node Directory
18: Time Options...

For non-synchronet systems, socket and stdio are both supported.  door.sys
should be used with the socket handle passed on the command-line:

jsdoor lord.js -d /path/to/door.sys -s <handle>

LORD.js also has an IGM installer/uninstaller.  From the LORD directory, you
can run the script using jsexec or jsdoor with the following syntax:

jsexec lord.js +IGM path/to/igm.js

This will add the IGM to your other places automatically.  To remove the IGM,
use -IGM.

LORD is configured via the lord.ini file.
