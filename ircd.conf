#
# For use with the Synchronet IRC daemon, based off of ircd.conf from
# Bahamut 1.4
#
# --- This file supports tokens.  The supported tokens are:
#
# SYSTEM_HOST_NAME	Your system hostname as defined in scfg
# SYSTEM_NAME		Your BBS name as defined in scfg
# SYSTEM_QWKID		Your QWKID as defined in scfg
# VERSION_NOTICE	The short form Synchronet version notice
#
# ---
#
#
# M: {MANDATORY} - This line sets the server name and description.
#
#   {M:Line Syntax}
# M:Hostname:IP(Unused):Server Description:Port(Unused)
#
M:SYSTEM_QWKID.synchro.net:*:SYSTEM_NAME:*
#
#
# A: {MANDATORY} - This line provides your administrative information, such as
# contact addresses.  This informationis viewed with /admin <server>.  The
# last part of your admin info MUST be a valid email address as per RFC1459.
#
A:SYSTEM_NAME (SYSTEM_QWKID):VERSION_NOTICE:Sysop- <sysop@SYSTEM_HOST_NAME>
#
#
# Y: {SUGGESTED} - These lines define connection classes, which allow you to
# fine-tune client and server connections.  Clients and servers should be 
# placed in seperate classes, and eachset of servers should have their own 
# class.  You may also wish to seperate clients into seperate classes based 
# on location.
#
# The class numbers are not arbitrary.  In auto-connecting servers, the higher
# number, the higher the auto-connect priority.
#
#   {Y:Line Syntax}
# Y:Class Number:Ping Frequency:Connect Frequency:Maximum Links:SendQ
#
# Ping Frequency - The amount of time (in seconds) that the server will wait
# before dropping the connection with Ping Timeout.
#
# Connect Frequency - The amount of time between attempts to connect to servers
# in that class.  Set this to 0 for client Y:Lines.
#
# {Synchronet} Y:Lines are unsupported as of version 1.0, but will be in the
# future.
#
# Class 50 - Hub to hub, autoconnect
Y:50:90:600:1:20000000
# Class 51 - Hub to EU hub, autoconnect
Y:51:180:600:1:20000000
# Class 33 - Hub to AS leaf
Y:33:240:0:0:15000000
# Class 32 - Hub to EU leaf
Y:32:180:0:0:15000000
# Class 30 - Hub to US leaf
Y:30:90:0:0:15000000
# Class 10 - for known Operators
Y:10:400:100:100:2000000
# Class 1 - Normal Users
Y:1:400:100:100:1000000
#
#
# I: {MANDATORY} - These lines are client-authorization lines.  Without them,
# clients will be unable to connect to your server.  Wildcards are permitted.
# You may also require a password or port to connect, but are optional.
#
# Ident (RFC 1413) can also be used by placing a @ in the appropriate fields.
#
#   {I:Line Syntax}
# I:IP Address Mask:Password:Domain-Mask:Port:Connection Class
#
# {Synchronet} I:Lines are unsupported as of 1.0, however they MAY be added
# in the future.
#
# Standard I:Line allowing anybody to connect to the server:
I:*@*::*@*::1
#
# Oper Hostmasking I:Line requiring the user to connect on a specific port (ie.
# 7139), and provide the correct password (ie. $packWitU:opernick:operpass):
#I:*@*:oper.$packWitU:*@*:7149:10
#
# Putting NOMATCH in the first field will stop the ircd from matching against
# the IP, and will force it to match against the hostname.
I:NOMATCH::rmiller@glass.toledolink.com::1
#
#
# O: {OPTIONAL} - These lines define IRC Operator access.
#
# If the user issuing the oper command is not coming from the hostname defined,
# the user will receive the error message "No O:Lines for your host". The class
# field denotes the Y:Line class that you want the user to end up in after
# they've successfully issued the /oper command.
#
# {Synchronet} All opers have global operator privledges.  This may change
# in the future, however, as of 1.0 per-operator flags (such as in Bahamut)
# are unsupported.
#
#   {O:Line Syntax}
# O:Hostname:Password:Nickname:AccessFlags(Ignored):Class
#
O:*@SYSTEM_HOST_NAME:SYSTEM_PASSWORD:Sysop:*:10
O:*jdoe@*.generic.com:j0hnsPa$$:john:*:10
#
#
# U: {OPTIONAL} - This line defines servers that are allowed to make changes to
# the IRC environment (ie. mode changes), without obstructing them.
#
#   {U:Line Syntax}
# U:Server Name:Unused:Unused
#
# {Synchronet} The following U:Line is required to connect to the Synchronet
# IRC network.
U:services.synchro.net:*:*
#
#
# X: {SUGGESTED} - This line defines the passwords required for an oper to
# /restart or /die the server, in addition to them having the R or D flags in
# their O:Line.
#
# {Synchronet} Unsupported as of 1.0
#
#   {X:Line Syntax}
# X:diepass:restartpass
#
#
# C: {NETWORKED} - These lines define what servers your server tries to connect
# to.
#
# N: {NETWORKED} - These lines define what servers are permitted to initiate
# connections to your server.
#
# C/N Lines MUST be used in pairs.  One cannot be used without the other.
#
# Both the C:Line's port field and the N:Line's flag field may be left blank.
# If a port is specified in the C:Line, your server will auto-connect.
#
# {Synchronet} Currently, Synchronet IRCD does not accept any flags, and
# definitely does NOT accept Bahamut 'E' or 'Z' connections (encrypted
# and/or gzipped.)
#
#   {C/N:Line Syntax}
# C:Remote Hostname:Password:Remote Servername:Port:Class
# N:Remote Hostname:Password:Remote Servername:Flags:Class
#
C:127.0.0.1:password:bahamut.synchro.net::30

C:127.0.0.1:password:services.synchro.net::30
N:127.0.0.1:password:services.synchro.net::30
#
#
# K: {OPTIONAL} - A simplified K:Line as per Synchronet, this is what you
# define to keep certain users from connecting to your server.  TEMPORARY
# K:Lines may be added via the IRC operator /KLINE command, but they are not
# saved on the fly.  Thus, all permanent K:Lines must be placed here by hand.
# Bahamut-style kline.conf is NOT supported.
#
#   {K:Line Syntax}
# K:hostmask:reason for kline
#
K:*@*.lamers.com:No lamers allowed
K:*root@*:For your own protection, don't IRC as root.
#
# q: {OBSOLETE} - q:lines have been removed from bahamut.
#
# Q: {OPTIONAL} - These lines prevent users on your server from using certain
# nicknames.  These are 'reserved' nick names that should not be taken by
# normal users.  * and ? wildcards are allowed inside the nickname field.
#
#   {Q:Line Syntax}
# Q:*:Reason:Nickname
#
# {Synchronet} These Q:Lines are required to link to the Synchronet IRC
# network.
#
Q::Reserved for Services:*Serv
Q::Reserved for Services:Global
Q::Reserved for Operators:IRCop
Q::Reserved for Sysop:Sysop
#
#
# Z: {DISCOURAGED} - These lines block ALL incoming connections from a certain
# IP address mask.  They are more powerful than K:Lines because they stop users
# before they've had a chance to register.  This works on servers too, so be
# VERY careful!  These lines should be used as a LAST RESORT!
#
# Z:lines do NOT work on hostnames.
#
#   {Z:Line Syntax}
# Z:IP:Reason for zapping:*
#
Z:0.0.0.0:Bogus/Spoofed IP:*
#
#
# H: {OPTIONAL} - These lines define who you allow to act as a hub.  The first
# field may use wildcards, and the third field MUST be an exact match for a
# server's name (NOT the server's hostname!).
#
#   {H:Line Syntax}
# H:Servers which are permitted::Hub Servername
H:*::vert.synchro.net
H:*::rrx.synchro.net
#
#
# P: {SUGGESTED} - This line allows the server to listen on various additional
# ports other than what was defined in your Synchronet services config file.
#
# {Synchronet} This is currently unsupported as of 1.0, but may be in the
# future.
#
#   {P:Line Syntax}
# P:Remote IP:Local IP:Unused:Port
#
#P:*:*::6667
#
#
# E: {DISCOURAGED} - These lines bypass K:Lines for matching clients.  
# Username is optional.
#
# Don't use these if you can avoid it!  Services will fight with them!
#
# {Synchronet} Unsupported as of 1.0, no plans to add this line in the
# immediate future.
#
#   {E:Line Syntax}
# E:Hostmask:Unused:Username
#
#E:*.twcny.rr.com::ayukawa
#
#
# F: {DISCOURAGED} - These lines bypass K:Lines and also class limits for 
# matching clients.  Username is optional.
#
# Don't use these if you can avoid it!  Services will fight with them!
#
# {Synchronet} Unsupported as of 1.0, no plans to add this line in the
# immediate future.
#
#   {F:Line Syntax}
# F:Hostmask:Unused:Username
#
#F:*.twcny.rr.com::*
#
#
# T: {OPTIONAL} - These lines override the default proxy monitor information.
# You should only have one T:Line.  If either field is left empty, the default
# will be used.
#
# Note: http:// is automatically prefixed on the specified URL
#
# {Synchronet} Proxy monitoring is unsupported as of 1.0, but may be in the
# future.  This is probably something that should be done at the services
# level as opposed to the server level.
#
#   {T:Line Syntax}
# T:Hostname:URL
#
#T:monitorbot.synchro.net:www.synchro.net/proxies
