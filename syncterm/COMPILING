To build SyncTERM, you *will need* the following bits from the Synchronet CVS
tree:

src/build/*
src/conio/*
src/sbbs3/telnet.c
src/sbbs3/telnet.h
src/sbbs3/zmodem.c
src/sbbs3/zmodem.h
src/sbbs3/xmodem.h
src/smblib/crc16.c
src/smblic/crc16.h
src/smblib/crc32.c
src/smblic/crc32.h
src/syncterm/*
src/uifc/*
src/xpdev/*

The directory structure under src *must* be kept intact.  Once you have all
this in place, a simple "make" should build everything you need.  If you're
using *nix you must use GNU Make... under some systems (Such a most BSDs) this
is optional and installed as "gmake" rather than "make".

Refer to src/build/Common.gmake or src/build/Common.bmake for details of some
of the make options the build system supports.
