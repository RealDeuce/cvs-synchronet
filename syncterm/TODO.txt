Add a "defaults" section of the ini (Just the top level) which will be used for
undefined values in each item as well as default values for a new item.

More per-BBS settings:
Upload Protocol
Download Protocol
ANSI Music/Delete Line toggle
Being able to override the default protocol from the command-line:
  syncterm -r vert.synchro.net	(RLogin)
  syncterm -t vert.synchro.net	(Telnet)
Specifying a BBS entry from the command-line
Themeing support... would require exposing extra bits of uifc (Specifically,
  the box chars used... the colours are already exposed) and possibly a
  character replacement table for r0dent stuff (Does Sync still have such a
  table laying about somewhere?).  This, along with the current output pacing
  stuff could make it a popular "scene" terminal.  AFAIK, the only other thing
  they would want is external protocol support... something that is far beyond
  what I'm willing to do (The FOSSIL emulator would need to get added, along
  with DSZ log parsing etc, bascially... it would be pointless bloat)
It would be nice to not need to switch to the full uifc screen for the menus,
  The reasons it does that currently is the time update stuff and the status
  line info.  There's really no good reason any of the rest of the screen needs
  to be overwritten/distrubed in any way.  In some circumstances, it's actually
  annoying.  I think that uifc32 will correctly handle a NULL pointer as the
  time update bit, so why has this not been done already?
