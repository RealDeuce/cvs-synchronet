Add a "defaults" section of the ini (Just the top level) which will be used for
undefined values in each item as well as default values for a new item.

More per-BBS settings:
Upload Protocol
Download Protocol
ANSI Music/Delete Line toggle
Being able to override the default protocol from the command-line:
  syncterm -r vert.synchro.net	(RLogin)
  syncterm -t vert.synchro.net	(Telnet)
Specifying a BBS entry from the command-line
Themeing support... would require exposing extra bits of uifc (Specifically,
  the box chars used... the colours are already exposed) and possibly a
  character replacement table for r0dent stuff (Does Sync still have such a
  table laying about somewhere?).  This, along with the current output pacing
  stuff could make it a popular "scene" terminal.  AFAIK, the only other thing
  they would want is external protocol support... something that is far beyond
  what I'm willing to do (The FOSSIL emulator would need to get added, along
  with DSZ log parsing etc, bascially... it would be pointless bloat)
Allow some way for SysOps (With the System Password) to auto-login... obviously,
  RLogin can't do this magically... need somewhere to enter it, ALT-L should
  send it etc.
Adding new entry should be streamlined... just prompt for name and addy, fill
  from (vapourware) defaults, then dump to the edit menu.
Edit menu should use menus, not advancing lists.
