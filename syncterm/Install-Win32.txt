Internet Explorer for Windows handles telnet preferences in a very different way
from other Internet browsers. Internet Explorer doesn't let you set preferences
from within the program. Instead, it works with the Windows operating system.

Note: The process of changing Windows telnet preferences is extremely complex
and should be attempted only by experienced users. If you do not set your
preferences correctly, you can disable Windows' inherent telnet ability and
possibly damage your operating system.

Note: You should know the correct path to get to your operating system's telnet
preferences before you attempt to change telnet settings; otherwise, your telnet
preferences won't work correctly.


From the Windows desktop, double-click My Computer. 


Since Internet Explorer changes the general Windows interface, this step varies
according to which version of Internet Explorer you have installed: 


If you use Internet Explorer 5.5, from the Tools menu, select
Internet Options. 
If you use Internet Explorer 5.0, from the View menu, choose Options or Folder
Options... . (For Internet Explorer 5.0 in Windows 2000, choose Tools, then
Folder Options... .) 


In the window that appears, choose the File Types tab. 


Scroll down the list of registered file types and select URL:Telnet Protocol. 


Click Open, and then Edit... . 
Note: Depending on the version of Internet Explorer that you have, you may need to click Edit... and then Edit... again. 

The Edit window will allow you to type the path to the telnet program you wish to use. When you are finished, click OK to close the windows. 

Now, do the same thing for URL:RLogin Protocol.
