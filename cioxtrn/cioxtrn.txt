Introduction
============
cioxtrn is a program in the spirit of the old DoorWay program.  It takes the
screen output of a console program and sends it as ANSI to stdout and reads
keystrokes from stdin which are sent to the program.

The main difference between cioxtrn and DoorWay is that cioxtrn is a Windows
program and supports Win32 consoles in addition to 16-bit programs running in a
windows console.

Usage
=====
To run a program under cioxtrn, simply pass the command line.  For example:
	cioxtrn c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe

When cioxtrn starts up, it changes the console screen size in an attempt to
match the remote users.  The screen height is automatically detected if
possible or assumed to be 24 rows and the screen width is always assumed to be
80 columns.

If something resizes the console window, it may still be usable.  cioxtrn
allows control of this via two mechanisms.

	1) -t and -b specified before the command.
		This forces cioxtrn to display the top (-t) or bottom (-b)
		of the screen.  For cmd.exe, -b would be best and for edit.com,
		-t (the default) would be best.
	2) CTRL-Z will toggle between the top and bottom display modes while
		using cioxtrn.

	Examples:
		cioxtrn -b C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe
		cioxtrn -t C:\windows\system32\edit.com

Extra key bindings:
===================
cioxtrn enables and uses doorway if the remote system supports it.  It will
also accept three extra keystrokes which do cioxtrn specific things.  The FIRST
time they are pressed, they only do the cioxtrn defined function and are not
passed to the remote.  Subsequent presses behave differently for each key as
described below:

	CTRL-A: Depresses and holds down the ALT key until the next keystroke.
		if the next keystroke is a CTRL-A, only CTRL-A is sent to the
		program, not CTRL-ALT-A.  As a result of this behaviour, there
		is no way to send CTRL-ALT-A.
	CTRL-R: On the first entry, forces a screen redraw.  Subsequent CTRL-R
		keystrokes without other intervening chars will be sent to the
		program.
	CTRL-Z: Toggles between displaying the top of the console buffer or the
		bottom.  This key ALWAYS toggles the display, but is also sent
		to the remote after the first press.
