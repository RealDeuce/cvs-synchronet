Synchronet/xpdev ini_file module
--------------------------------
The basic format of the files supported by the xpdev ini_file module is that
of the Windows .ini file, with some additional features.

The basic Windows .ini file format is as follows:

1. The file contains ASCII text only with LF or CR/LF-terminated lines.

2. The file is separated into logical "sections". Each section may have its
   own list of keys with associated values, one per line.

3. A section begins with a line consisting only of "[" <section name> "]".

4. White space before or after the section name is ignored.

5. A section ends when the end of file is reached or a new section begins.
 
6. Keys and associated values within a section are specified, each on their
   line, in the format: <key_name> "=" <value>

7. White space before and after the key/value separator ("=") is ignored.

8. Comments are lines with the first printing char a semicolon (";").

9. Blank lines between or within sections are ignored.

Example basic Windows .ini file content:

; for 16-bit app support
[fonts]
[extensions]
[Mail]
MAPI=1
CMCDLLNAME32=mapi32.dll
CMCDLLNAME=mapi.dll
CMC=1
MAPIX=1
MAPIXVER=1.0.0.1
OLEMessaging=1
[SciCalc]
layout=0
[MSUCE]
Advanced=1
CodePage=Unicode
Font=Terminal


Synchronet/xpdev extended-ini_file format
-----------------------------------------
The Synchronet/xpdev ini_file module supports a somewhat "extended" .ini file
format with the following additions:

1. Root section
   Key/value pairs in the file *before* the first section definition are
   considered part of the "root" section. This section is often used to define
   key/value pairs that apply globally to all the following sections. The root
   section may have other uses as well.

2. Literal string values
   String values separated by the key name with a colon (':') instead of an
   equals sign ('='), are parsed as "literal" strings, which means the string
   will retain any trailing white-space on the line. This may be enhanced in
   the future to support C escape sequences, multiple broken lines, etc.

3. Section name list
   If one wishes to specify a list of sections for all values to be applied to
   they may specify a list of section names, separated by '|', where a single
   section name would normally be specified. Example:
   "[telnet|rlogin]"
