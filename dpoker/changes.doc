                  Domain Poker  (c) 1992 Domain Entertainment
                                Program Changes


09/17/92 - VERSION 1.00 Release

    Finally released the DEMO version of Domain Poker and made it available
for purchase.


VERSION 1.01

    Made a few cosmetic changes, changed the '(x)' in front of the player
status prompts to 'Node x: '.  Corrected a spelling error in one of the menus
('list users onliner' to 'list users online').
    Made the game check for node to node Synchronet messages at the main menu
prompt rather than only in the game.
    The timer for computer play was counting time from multi-user games and the
players would end up with less time available to play against the computer.
Now it only counts time played against the computer.
    Added (for non-demo versions) implementation for a sysop information file.
If a file named "DPOKER.SYS" exists in the poker directory, it will be dis-
played upon entering the game (right after the Domain Poker header, and right
before the menu commands).  Useful if the SysOp wants to pass on information to
the users who play the game, and it WILL recognize ctrl-a color codes.
    There was a possibility that stray messages could be left over from
previous games and read in, now the game deletes any existing stray messages
upon entry to a table.
    When a player hits 'P' for the player log (from the entry prompt), after
the names are done listing, it will show the user his/her totals for the day
(if their name appears in the log).
    Found a non-destructive, but very annoying bug.  When in a game of > 2
players, if the player before the dealer raised the bet, the dealer folded,
and the player after the dealer called (in that order) the game would hang.

VERSION 1.02

    Minor changes to computer betting strategy (noticed some potential
problems, not real significant but fixed them anyway).  Saved last version
in case these changes make no improvement (DPOKER.ORG).
    Found that the last bug fixed in v1.01 was not completely fixed, Missed
a spot in the code that would cause the same problem in an even rarer instance.
    The game no longer needs the node directory specified on the command line,
it is now read from the environment.

VERSION 1.03

    Updated with the new XSDK version 2.03.
    Implemented new "Beg" screens for the DEMO copy for distribution with
Synchronet.

VERSION 1.10

    Updated with a major XSDK update (version 2.10).
    Was unnecessarily creating player files before a player had actually
gotten to a table, now the file is created only when a slot on a table has
been found for that player.

VERSION 1.11

    There was a chance for garbage to sneak into the game status file and
cause problems in single as well as multi-player games, this is now fixed.
    Just realized that there was only one deck of cards ever created for the
entire game, now there is one deck of cards generated for each table being
played like there should be.

VERSION 1.12

    Missed a spot when fixing the "garbage" bug from version 1.11.
    Noticed that the computer player was being disabled one table from where it
should have been (ie: if there were no computer player allowed on tables 6 and
above, it would actually affect tables 5 and up).
    The "Current Table" is now initialized to zero from startup.
    Recompiled with new XSDK (version 2.11).

VERSION 1.13

    Bug found for boards running > 10 nodes.  I was initializing the number
of "hands" of cards to the number of players per table (6) and should have
been initializing it to the number of nodes the system has (but instead, went
ahead and initialized it to the max number of nodes).
    The clean-up program was leaving some stray files around for some reason,
I now have it search for the maximum possible filenames and delete them (1 thru
250).

VERSION 1.14

    A previous bug fix (hanging problem in v1.01) was inserted in the wrong
place making it so the computer did get a chance to bet on the final raise.
    The computer was 'Calling' on the initial bet which shouldn't be allowed
as a choice.
