                        The Story of The Beast's Domain

    chYou've been noticing a recent turmoil in the city.  The King, who has
been ruling this land for as long as you can remember, seems to be slowly but
surely losing control of the people.  Chaos begins to overcome a once tamed
land, and it seems as though the people no longer have the respect for the King
that they once did.
    Upon passing a bulletin board on a local tavern, you see a notice that
reads:
                    mATTENTION: nmThe King needs YOUR help,
                    proceed immediately to the castle to enter
                    the service of the King!  Only the strong
                    willed, and true of heart need join.

    chIgnoring the jeers of the others reading the sign (and the occasional
"Damn right he needs help!") you proceed immediately to the castle, you're no
slouch, you're faithful to your King and your community, and if you can be of
service to the King, you plan to do all that you can to help out.

    Once you reach the castle, you are interrogated by several of what appear
to be the King's last few faithful guards, apparently to see what your
intentions actually are.  You are then brought before the King, you are seated,
and the King speaks:

    y"Thank you for coming my son, you see, something very terrible has
happened.  Several nights ago, a hideous and powerful Beast came into the
kingdom, and with a power I have never seen before, ripped my staff away from
the magical powers that bind it to me.  At first I thought little of what had
happened, but now I realize that the staff must empower me with the ability to
rule this land peacefully.  I fear that without it, the chaos and turmoil will
worsen, and all will be destroyed."

    "Upon consulting with the Sage guild, I find that the Beast must live
through the Desert of Death, in a castle somewhere in the Forest of Evil.
It is believed that the Beast lurks in the dungeon of the castle, and it is
known that few have actually made it to the castle entrance.
    There are creatures of evil lurking everywhere near the castle.  Don't be
hasty in your journey, it has been told that the closer you get to the Beast,
the deadlier and more vicious the evil creatures become.  Before you can defeat
this evil, you must first become an able fighter."

    "It is believed that in this area there are also merchants that have taken
up residence.  What protects their shops from the evil is unknown, it's almost
as if the Beast lets them reside there so that adventurer's like yourself will
have the tools necessary to make things more 'sporting'.
    It is also believed that there are magical fountains of water that have the
power to restore and revive you."

    "All the treasures you may find in the land of the Beast are yours to keep,
I ask only that you retrieve my staff from the Beast, so that I may once again
restore peace throughout the land."

    cThe King pats you on the shoulder, and you suddenly feel even more eager
to retrieve the King's staff.  You decide to set off on your journey.
