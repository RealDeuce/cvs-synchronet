      A Multi-Player Interactive Adventure Game For Synchronet BBS Systems
                        Player Instructions And Commands

    mhWelcome to The Beast's Domain, this is a REAL TIME adventure game for
up to 250 players.  Because the game is played in REAL TIME, the commands are
probably used very differently than any other online game you've ever played.
The following text will give you basic instructions on how to play, move your
character around, and the various functions of the different command keys.
Although the commands and their functions are always on the play screen for
you to view, it is to your benefit to read through this file to get a better
working knowledge of what everything does.

    First we'll start off at the opening screen.  Here you are given a few
commands to choose from:

    'yHm' How to play The Beast's Domain, this will display the file that
    you are currently looking at.

    'yEm'nter The Beast's Domain, this command will (obviously) take you
    into the game, when you are ready to start game play, use this command.

    'yCm'ost to play The Beast's Domain, some Sysops may wish to charge a
    cost to play the game.  If they do, this command will appear, and you can
    select it to see just how much it costs to play.

    'yQm'uit back to <BBS Name>, if you do not wish to enter The Beast's
    Domain for any reason, select this, and you will be immediately returned
    to the BBS.

    Now let's take a look at the various commands you can use during game
play.  These commands are always available on the screen during game play,
but it's best to get a good knowledge of how to do things in case of split
second emergencies (which can occur in this type of REAL TIME environment).
Note that the commands are geared for use with the NUMERIC KEYPAD on your
keyboard.  If you do not have a numeric keypad, there are alternate commands
for everything which are also shown.  Note that a command of '0/R' means
that if you are using the numeric keypad, you would use '0', otherwise you
will need to use 'R' for that command.  Also note that you must have the
NUM LOCK turned ON in order to use the numeric keypad during the game.

    Now let's check out what are called the 'Game Commands', these commands
are always shown on the right hand side of the screen during game play:

     ySm Send Message in Game
        This command is used for INTER-Game chatting.  When you use this
        command, the screen will remain intact (unlike when using the ^P
        command), and you will be able to send a message to ANY node within
        the game (not limited by ^P limitations).
        Notice that during game play, the bottom portion of the screen
        will display a list of numbers and names (ie:"01:King Dra"), this
        is the NODE NUMBER you will need to use when sending messages, and
        the first 8 characters of the name of the person on that node.
        Selecting 'R' from this command will allow you to send a message to
        all the players in the current ROOM.

    y^Pm Send Message to BBS
        This command is the same as the command on the BBS to send messages,
        using this command you can send messages to other people who are
        currently using the BBS.

    y^Um List Users Online
        This command is also the same as the command on the BBS, pressing this
        will display a list of users currently on the bulletin board, and what
        they are doing.

    y^Rm Redraw Screen
        You will need to use this command if for any reason the format of the
        screen gets messed up.  You will probably want to use this any time
        the screen gets garbage on it (usually caused by line noise and bad
        connections).

    yTm Terminate Session
        Select this command when you wish to exit from The Beast's Domain,
        you will be brought back to the BBS upon selecting this.

    y+m Pickup an Object
        When you move your character over the top of an object, a description
        of that object will be displayed under the map area of the screen.
        If you wish to carry this object with you to use on your journey,
        use this command to pick it up.

    y-m Drop an Object
        Exactly the opposite of the previous command.  If you wish to drop
        something you are carrying, move to an empty spot in the dungeon,
        and select this command.  You will be shown a list of what you are
        carrying, select the number of the object you wish to drop, or press
        ENTER if you don't wish to drop anything.  You can not drop an object
        on top of another object.

    y0/Rm Toggle Weapon
        This command will ready any weapon you may be carrying (if you aren't
        carrying a weapon, you are basically readying yourself to fight, and
        you will be using your hands).  When you run into monsters or other
        players when you are 'Readied for combat' you are attempting to strike
        them, and will do damage.

        NOTE: If you run into players without your weapon drawn, you will not
              harm them, and the game will display who that person is (unless
              they are invisible!).  Running into monsters, however, will
              always result in the monster attacking you.  Also note that you
              cannot pick up items or use gateways and stairs with your weapon
              ready, and if you enter a shop with your weapon out, it will
              automatically be put away.

    y./Im Toggle Inventory
        You'll notice that the left hand side of the screen, during game play,
        will display a 'Compass' with the movement keys on it, and the
        direction the key will move you.  This command will switch the right
        hand side of the screen display between this 'Compass' and your
        character's inventory.

    y5/Um Use Special Item
        On your journey, you may wish to make use of the different magical
        items you come across.  In order to do so, select this command.  You
        will be given a list of the items that you are carrying to choose
        from, just select the item you wish to use, or press ENTER if you
        change your mind.

    That's it for the 'Game Commands', before moving on to moving on to
movement commands, let me give you a quick run down on how the shops work in
this game.  Since this is a REAL TIME adventure game, most things work quite
a bit differently than they do in single player adventure games.

    cPurchasing an Item:nc When you enter a shop, you can purchase an
    item by simply moving over the top of the item you'd like to buy, and
    pressing the '+' (pickup an object) key.  In the case of weapon and
    armor shops, if you are already carrying armor or a weapon, when you
    press the '+' key, the shopkeeper will offer you money for what you
    already have in trade for the new armor or weapon.

    mhThat's about it for buying in shops (you cannot sell things to shops,
you can only buy or trade things).  Now let's move on to the movement commands.
These commands appear on the left hand side of the screen during game play:

    y8/Wm This command will move you NORTH (UP)
    y7/Qm This command will move you NORTHWEST (Diagonally UP to the LEFT)
    y9/Em This command will move you NORTHEAST (Diagonally UP to the RIGHT)
    y4/Am This command will move you WEST (LEFT)
    y6/Dm This command will move you EAST (RIGHT)
    y1/Zm This command will move you SOUTHWEST (Diagonally DOWN to the LEFT)
    y3/Cm This command will move you SOUTHEAST (Diagonally DOWN to the RIGHT)
    y2/Xm This command will move you SOUTH (DOWN)

    That's it for movement commands.  Now for some information on the items
displayed on the screen during game play.  First you'll notice that the middle
of the screen is the room you are in.  You can move around this room, and
moving through a door in the room will take you to another room.
    Directly above the map portion of the screen, there is a display showing
'TIME', 'LEVEL' and 'HEALTH'.  The TIME is the amount of time you have left
in the game, LEVEL is your character's current level, and HEALTH is your health
status.
    To the right of the map section of the screen are the GAME COMMANDS, to
the left will either be the character's inventory or the map movement commands
(toggled using the './I' command).
    Directly below the map section/menu sections of the screen are 3 status
lines.  They will give you information during the game on what is going on,
what you've picked up or run into, who you are fighting, and the damage you
are taking (as well as other things).
    The bottom half of the screen will display messages that are sent to you
by other players, or by the BBS.

    Here is a list of the various symbols used in the game which are used to
represent objects, this is only a partial list, and includes all the items
that will NOT harm you along with their corresponding colors.  Other symbols
that you may see in the game are most likely monsters!

yWeapons/Armor (from least potent to most potent):

    nbhm - A Dagger
    bm - A Long Dagger                   bém - Leather Armor
    gm - A Short Sword                   gém - Studded Leather Armor
    cm - A Long Sword                    cém - Scale Mail Armor
    rm - A Broad Sword                   rém - Chain Mail Armor
    mm - A Bastard Sword                 mém - Banded Armor
    ym - A Two-Handed Sword              yém - Plate Mail Armor

yMagical Items:

    bèm - Scroll of Warp to Other         bëm - Potion of Invisibility
    gèm - Potion of Healing               gëm - Scroll of Extra Healing
    mèm - Mystery Scroll                  mëm - Mystery Potion
    cëm - Potion of Full Heal             yëm - Potion of Strength
    røm - Ring of Resurrection            w@m - Magical Compass

    NOTES: The 'Scroll of Warp to Other' will instantly transport to another
           (random) player in the dungeon.  If there is no one else in the
           game, you will remain in the same spot, and you will lose the
           scroll.  This is not good if you plan on mapping, but it also very
           useful in dangerous situations.
           The 'Potion of Strength' will allow you to do DOUBLE damage on
           hits for the duration of the potion.
           The 'Ring of Resurrection' will bring you back to life if you get
           killed, you will be reset to NO experience points, but you will
           retain all of your items, and your position in the dungeon.
           What do the 'Mystery' items do?  Many things, but you've gotta
           try them to find out what each one does!
           If you run across a Magical Compass on your journey, it will display
           the X;Y co-ordinates of the current map sector you are in.

yMiscellaneous Objects:

             wm - Another Player (can be any color)
        gðm or yðm - Stairs going up or down
    gãm, cãm, or rãm - Shopkeeper
             gm - Tree
             y°m - Quicksand
             nmh - Brick
             nb÷mh - Water
             nìmh - Rock

    That's about it.  Enjoy the game, and happy adventuring!
