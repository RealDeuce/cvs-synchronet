!!!!WARRNING!!!!

If you had v2.0 to 2.7 installed on your system READ THIS!

If you have v2.8 or v3.x installed on your system, no upgrade is neccessary.

Please run the v2xtov28.exe utility to upgrade your question file, if
you had 2.0 - 2.7 istalled.

Run this program in the utility that the FREEVOTE.QST file is located!

This has to be run for the door to function properly.

Sorry about this but the reserved flag was not zeroed properly so it's value
was either 1 or 0 depending on the version. So this upgrade is necessary.

This new flag is the one used for forced questions, if this is not run all
of the questions you have now installed could turn into forced questions!
This program zeros that flag so that it defaults all old questions to
non-forced...
