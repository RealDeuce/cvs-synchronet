Conversion notes for Linux

Some notes on how to convert this to linux:

- change all filenames to lowercase
- move all .h includes into one large .h file
- change all sprintf, strcpy, etc. so that they do not contain buffer overflows which may be exploitable
- file locking (_fsopen et al) must use flock() and others (?)
