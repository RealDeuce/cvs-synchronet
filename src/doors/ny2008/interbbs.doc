New York 2008 InterBBS Documentation

New York v0.10 and higher have the ability to be set up as an interbbs
door over any fido style network or even locally (have two installations
of the game fight against each other on the same bbs)

How It Works...
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

There is one "operator" system, which is the central system, the sysop
of that bbs controls and sends out the node list and basically maintains
the whole game. Read on for instructions for the "operator" bbs.

The rest of the boards are regular game nodes.

There can be up to 255 bbses in one game ....

There can be up to 32000 games, so that one bbs can run more than one
interbbs game (league) at a time.

The game never has to be reset, unless you want to ... The best winner lists
will never be reset (unless each system would delete the "NYBEST.TEN" file)
The game is made so that the bbses can compete for the best average player
score. Or just player can compete between each other. It's like in local
games if one player wins he's added to the ten best list (if he's good enough)
and he is reset, but the rest of the game can just keep on playing.
I all depends on how the players want to play the game. It's best not
to work together actually, but to compete even between local players since
thats' the way to get points. I guess it will be more a battle of individuals
more then a battle of bbses ....

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
If you are a normal bbs wanting to join in a game ....

Make sure you are a registered sysop, otherwise the interbbs stuff will NOT
work ... on info how to register, read REGISTER.DOC

The Inter-BBS is enabled by a keyword in the game .cfg file (usually
"NY2008.CFG"), "InterBBS" set that, make sure that "InterBBSOperator" is not
set unless you are the "operator" bbs. And make sure you put down the
game number you are joining under "InterBBSGameNumber" keyword.

Copy SAMPLEIB.CFG to INTERBBS.CFG then edit the INTERBBS.CFG with your info.

Set up the interbbs maintanance modes in your nightly batch file.

There are two modes ... which are controlled by command line options.
You use these with the NYIBBS.EXE file! You can specify -C option with
nyibbs.exe to specify a .cfg file or make sure the ny2008.cfg file contains
the bbs name, interbbs number and the other info. The nyibbs.exe also reads
INTERBBS.CFG for the remaining interbbs info.

-ibbso = Proccess all outgoing information, should be run before you proccess
         and send your mail that day. 
-ibbsi = Proccess all incoming information, should be run after you proccess
         and recieve all mail that day.

So in your nightly batch file you'd first run:

 nyibbs -ibbso

 then you would proccess your mail and send it with your front door or another
 mailer, and you would get all the incoming mail, just like usual. After that
 you would run:

 nyibbs -ibbsi

Run your game as you normally would with no other options ... just make sure
that the .cfg file which the game is using (usually NY2008.CFG) has interbbs
enabled and contains the right game number.

You have to contact the "operator" of the game you want to join and have him
add you to the node list and send out a new one. You will get it
automatiacally if you setup everything right. You will need to supply him
with some information, Your FIDO(or other fido style net) node number,
Your BBS name and Your location(city and state should do).

If you recieve the nodelist the game will automatically request player lists
from other bbses and the game can begin. You don't have to get the nodelist
yourself since the "operator" bbs sends it out and the game will recieve and
read it automatically. To check if everything went well, check if you have
recieved the nodelist, the filename is "NYNODE.LST", it migth take a few days,
depending on how far your bbs is from the "operator" system which sent out the
nodelist. So if you are impatient you can get the nodelist from the "operator"
bbs yourself ... so you can start the game earlier. But basically you don't
have to worry about anything .. it's all done automatically ...

And thats' it you are now part of the game .... pretty easy eh? ....

If you want to get out, of the game, run ny2008 RESET and select the kill
interbbs option. It will not reset the game. Then tell the "operator" system
so he can take you out of the nodelist.

If you are the "operator" BBS

There can only be one "operator" BBS in any InterBBS game. If you are the
operator you will be maintaining the nodelist for the game and basically
overseeing the game. Look at "SAMPLE.LST" file for creating a nodelist.
Once you cerated a nodelist and all of the systems that the nodelist
contains have their systems set up for interbbs, and all have the
game number in the interbbs.cfg file set to the same number, just run:

nyibbs -sendnodelist

This will read the nodelist and send it to all the systems in the nodelist.

If you ever add or delete a system, just run this again and all the nodelists
on all the systems (including the one you added) will be updated.

That's basically all you have to do, remember you have to have the
"InterBBSOperator" option set in your config file if you are one, otherwise
it will not work.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
LOCAL IBBS GAMES! (If having remote games use the setup above!)

If you want to run a local league, just create the node file, select one
of the games to be the operator, install the games in different directories.
If you set the flag dir in the config file, these have to be different too.

Create a directory where to put mail. Then set it as the mail directory in
the interbbs.cfg of each game installation. This should be something like
'C:\DOOR\NY2008\MSG'

In the nodelist create "fake" node nubers like, 1:1/1 or similiar. Assign
a different one to each game installation.

There are 3 ways to run the local games, You will need to run

  NYIBBS -IBBSI
  NYIBBS -IBBSO

In your batchfile every night in each game's directory no matter how
you choose to run the game itself.

I)
 For slow response time but fast game startup, just run the game as you
 would for a non-interbbs game. This makes the response time slow (the time
 it takes for mail and stuff to get from one game to the other) but the game
 starts up fast

II)
 Run the game as you allways would but add -IBBSM as another command line
 argument. This will proccess the mail every time the game is entered, but
 it will not proccess any other info, most player interaction is done through
 mail anyway ... xcept spying. So you would run the game like this

 NY2008 -IBBSM <put all your other command line arguments here>

III) 
 To make the game response fastest, but entering the game will be slower,
 put this in your batchfile

  NYIBBS -IBBSI
  NY2008 <the command line arguments to run the game>

 this will make the interaction between the nodes the fastest, though it might
 slow things down for the user, since he will have to wait for the incoming
 stuff to be proccessed, but this will be no problem for small games but if
 there aren't more then a few game installations then it should be no problem.
 Make sure you run the -IBBSI for each game installation at least once a day
 so that you don't get a big pileup of all the .MSG files. And make sure you
 also run the -IBBSO once a day so that the scores and stuff can be proccesed,
 this don't have to be run after the game, once a day is enough and will still make the ibbs
 game responsive.

Remember the -IBBSI and -IBBSO options don't have remote output, so make sure
they don't take too long if you are running them while somebody is online.

OK have fun ...
