Sometime in February 1995

Started working on New York. At this time it was still supposed to be a

12/18/1995
----------
Finished all fixes and compiled 0.04 and I think I will release it in the 
morning. Actually it is the morning, but I have not yet slept:)

1/26/1996
---------
Fineshed all i planned for this release ... not much but it makes the game 
much more stable (well as long as the new stuff is working correctly:)!
The new ver # is v0.05

1/28/1996
---------
I just remembered one feature which was supposed to be in 0.05 but I forgot 
about it ... so I relased v0.05a which includes this new feature ... I will 
dist it a bit today and tommorow .. no big deal ...

During most of February 1996
----------------------------
I'm working on the new version v0.10, it is now named v0.06 and is only
on my BBS ... Wow just realized ... this is exactly a year after I started
working on New York ... v0.10 will probably be the biggest release since
WB1 ... Since there are BIG changes ... look at the WHATSNEW.DOC file.

3/23/1996
---------
I have finaly cought a bug that I have been stalking for the last couple of
weeks. It was a VERY VERY nasty overflow bug, that occured in interbbs mail
So it seems I'm getting VERY close to the first beta of v0.10 ...

3/23/1996
---------
BETA 1 of v0.10 Will be released today or tommorrow ... some ibbs stuff is not
implemented yet but enough is to test how the interbbs works. I have finished
making temporary rip screens.

3/24/1996
---------
BETA 1 was released the 23rd, 1 year and 6 days after BETA 1 of v0.01
was released. And exactly 1 year after BETA 4 of v0.01 was released.

3/28/1996
---------
Just finished all I need for BETA 2, but haven't tested it yet ... I'll do
that tommorrow.

4/2/1996
--------
I'm waiting for .MSG packets from beta sites so I can resolve the problem
of them not being read in. So I did a little (ok a lot) of optimizing and
saved around 18k of the exe file!

4/5/1996
--------
Well just about finished with BETA 2 since I solved that problem with the
.msg packets hopefully ... so I'm testing it right now and I will release
it tommorrow.

4/7/1996
--------
Well I had a large problem with the .exe file and large memory model. To
avoid switching to huge, I took the interbbs -ibbsi, -ibbso, and
-sendnodelist and made a separate .exe file for that ... I just finished but
have not tested it yet.

4/14/1996
---------
Ok finally found the problem, well a couple of them, it wasn't the memory
model nor too large exefile, but a few bad pointer assigments and too short
declared strings ... A LOT OF STUFF .... So it seems to be all working right
now i will have to test it and change one more thing before putting out the
beta 2

4/15/1996
---------
Everything seems to be working so I'm releasing beta 2!

4/27/1996
---------
I don't have much time with finals coming up, I fixed the online fight bug in
beta 2. Also I found a couple of bugs in the interbbs and fixed them. Still
some are lurking around. I'm releasing this as BETA 3 today.

5/17/1996
---------
Summer finally:) ... I have decided to make the BETA 3 available to the
public as wide beta 1 as I have not gotten enough feedback from the beta
sites.

7/7/1996
--------
I have made some changes to the manuals and the distro site list but have
not distributed it since I have a more then a full time job and no time for
ny2008 ...

8/28/1996
---------
I have made more changes to docs, plus added more weapons and worked on
the program a bit. I'm releasing 0.11 as the first 0.1? non-beta release!

11/24/1996
----------
I fixed a few bugs, the wepons selecting bug and a mail bug. 0.12 is out.
no new big releases are coming too soon since registrations are slow and 
I have a lot of other projects. I WILL keep supporting this software 
though, releasing, bug fixes as they come in. I plan a Win95/NT version. 
This might take a little time but I think I will get to that this spring 
at least, maybe sooner.

12/25/1996
----------
I'm waiting to getting all my new internet stuff set up before releasing 
another version, bad words support are in plus a few other things I've done.

4/22/1997
---------
Tired of not getting regs. THE GAME IS FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
v1.00 released!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ok so this is the end of ny2008 development .. I will make sources available 
as well ... for anybody wanteing to port mess around with it use it ...
whatever.

Franz
