Here it is, the Time Port source code -- everything you should need to compile
Time Port. You'll want to get the TPORT11A.ZIP file as well, which contains
the original files (Ansi's, docs, and so forth). Then, you should be able
to use this source code to re-compile new EXE's (I'd keep them in a separate
directory from the original TPORT11A stuff) to replace the originals.

NOTE: You also need QuickBASIC 4.5 and Jeff Sumberg's QBSerial library
(although I included the necessary QBSER .OBJ file for compiling).

I've released this source code in the hopes that other BBS door authors
(or would-be authors) can find good use for it. I've received lots of
email over the years asking for help -- I simply don't have time to be
everybody's personal tutor, although I wish I did. Instead of providing
small snippets of code (which I may also do in the future), I'm releasing
source to a large, complete, working, RPG/Adventure door game! Time Port
was based on the Lunatix source code -- so much of it is IDENTICAL to
Lunatix 4.xx, including the player load/save, COLOR CODE routines, and
so forth. And in case you're wondering, NO, I will *not* be releasing the
source code to Lunatix... at least not for many many... MANY years. :)

Even if you don't want to modify & re-compile Time Port, there should be
a wealth of good routines here for creating your own BBS door game. If you
use it (and ESPECIALLY if you use a lot of it) please give credit to me for
the original program from which your work is based. I'd also appreciate
a mention on any web pages that you display files for download that were
based upon this source code. :)

You'll notice that many of the source files duplicate the work of the others.
This is because they're all "stand-alone" modules... or IGM's. Even though
they're a necessary part of they game, the entire Time Port structure is
strung together as a series of IGM's... Outside, Twenties, Stoneage, etc...
each one is an IGM... you may even be able to use them as examples to create
NEW time port IGM's!!!

The "CREATE.BAT" file is used to compile all the Time Port QB files. You
might need to alter it to show the path to your QuickBASIC compile/link
files (LINK.EXE, BC.EXE, BCOM45.LIB). For my setup, BC.EXE and LINK.EXE
are in the path, and BCOM45.LIB is in my C:\QB\ directory, so CREATE.BAT
is set up this way.

The "BAS.BAT" can be used to compile a single program. Pass it the BASIC
program name to compile, such as "BAS TWENTIES" or "BAS STONEAGE" to
compile/link a single Time Port file.
