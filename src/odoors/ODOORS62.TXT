*nix (using StdIO only) update to Brian Pirie's OpenDoors Library 

August 22, 2002

Door32.sys and Socket update to Brian Pirie's OpenDoors Library 
(http://www.pirieworld.ca/opendoors.html) 

by Rob Swindell (http://www.synchro.net/)

The current source code is always available via CVS at cvs.synchro.net.

The latest and greatest Win32 ODoors62.dll can always be downloaded here:
http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/src/odoors/ODoors62.dll

==============================================================================

This archive includes the source code to the OpenDoors library with 
modifications made by me (Rob Swindell, aka Digital Man) to add support for 
the Door32.sys drop file format and Win32 TCP/IP socket (Telnet) 
communications.

I made my modifications to the 6.1.1 release by Brian Pirie (ods611.zip) and
used Microsoft Visual C++ v6.0. I also eliminated any warnings or errors
detected by this compiler. The linker still warns of duplicate symbol 
definition (od_control and od_printf), but I left those duplicate defintions
in the .def file since they may have been necessary for another platform or
compiler that I'm not using.

This version also includes the ODEmu.c:od_send_file_section() modification 
by Michael Dillon (gsvalore@arn.net | http://members.darktech.org/gsvalore/).


DOOR32.SYS
----------
The Door32.sys drop file format was created in June of 2000 to support the
new wave of 32-bit Windows and *nix doors. The main feature of this
drop file format is that it includes the currently open Win32 comm handle or 
socket descriptor (whichever is appropriate for the current connection).

I didn't add support for the Win32 comm handle in the door32.sys file
(I run a telnet-only BBS and would have no way to test it). I can't
imagine it would be very difficult to add; I'm just not sure how much demand
there would be for such a feature today.

I did however add support for the socket descriptor in the drop file (used for
TCP/IP - Telnet connections) and this is currently the only "standard" drop 
file format that is expected to include a socket descriptor (Synchronet's 
XTRN.DAT drop file also includes a socket descriptor, but I don't really 
consider that format to be a "standard").

The Door32.sys drop file is currently supported by the following known BBS
packages:

    Software     Home Page                             Version
    -----------+-------------------------------------+--------
    Mystic BBS   www.mysticbbs.com                        1.07
    EleBBS       www.elebbs.com                           0.08?
    Synchronet   www.synchro.net                           3.x


TCP SOCKET I/O
--------------
When using a Door32.sys drop file, the communications type (Local, Serial, or 
Telnet) is automatically determined and I added support for (and tested) the 
Telnet/socket communication method using Synchronet BBS Software v3.10 for 
Win32 and HyperTerminal Private Edition v6.1.

Since the Telnet protocol specifies that an end-of-line sequence (ENTER or 
Carriage Return) is a CRLF (ASCII 13, 10), I had to modify od_get_key() to 
ignore any line feed (ASCII 10, Ctrl-J) characters. Without this modification, 
hitting enter in most Telnet clients would cause a "double return" to be sent 
to the door. There may be a more desirable solution to the problem, but this 
one seems to work for now.

v6.21 fixes a bug in the socket disconnection ("carrier-loss") detection in 
v6.20. I also lowered the input and carrier-detect thread priorities down to 
"normal" which makes the doors appear to run faster and also make debugging
continuous loop problems (like the one in v6.20) much easier.

v6.22 changes:
Another bug fixed in socket disconnection ("carrier-loss") detection.
Added support for non-blocking sockets (e.g. EleBBS) - thanks to GSValore.
Added support for the "-SOCKET" command-line option to specify the socket
descriptor on the command-line.

v6.23 changes:
*nix support using stdio

v6.24 chagnes:
Fixed timeing bugs on *nix
Fixed output truncated bug on *nix
Fixed od_get_input() hang on ESC on Win32
Fixed various other bugs.
Added od_key_pending() function.
