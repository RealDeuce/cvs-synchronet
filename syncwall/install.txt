1) Introduction
---------------

SyncWall is an interBBS ANSI whiteboard (blackboard?) that allows users to
draw on a shared canvas simultaneously.  The canvas is reset once each
month.  When launched, SyncWall cycles through the current month's canvas'
history, quickly replaying its progress from a blank slate to its current
state.


2) Installation
---------------

SyncWall depends on several libraries that any fully up-to-date Synchronet
BBS installation should already have. If you don't already do this regularly,
back up your BBS and then grab the latest updates from CVS.

SyncWall also relies on access to a JSON database, which you may host locally
or (more preferably) access remotely.  See section three for more information.

I'll assume that your copy of Synchronet is installed at /sbbs.  Bear that in
mind as you follow these instructions.

- In SCFG (/sbbs/exec/scfg, or BBS->Configure from the Synchronet Control
  Panel in Windows), select "External Programs" from the main menu.

- Select "Online Programs (Doors)"

- Select "Main" (or whichever of your program groups you feel is the best
  category to fit SyncWall into for your system.)

- Select "Available Online Programs..."

- Add a new item with the following details:

  Name: SyncWall
  Internal Code: SyncWall
  Command Line: ?/sbbs/xtrn/syncwall/syncwall.js
  Multiple Concurrent Users: Yes

- If you would like SyncWall to run during your logon or logoff process,
  select "Execute on Event" and select the appropriate event.  Set the
  "Execute on Event Only" option to yes only if you don't want SyncWall
  to appear in the list of available online programs after the user has
  logged in.

- Leave all other options at their default values. Hit ESC until SCFG exits,
  saving your changes when prompted


3) The SyncWall JSON database
-----------------------------

  3.1) Connect to the shared SyncWall database at bbs.electronicchicken.com:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  In xtrn/syncwall, create a text file named "server.ini".  Edit that file so
  that it contains the following two lines:
  
  host = bbs.electronicchicken.com
  port = 10088
  
  Your SyncWall instance will now connect to the shared database.  You and
  your users will see what has been drawn (or is being drawn) on every other
  BBS that uses this same datastore.
  
  3.2) Host your own wall
  -----------------------
  By default, SyncWall will attempt to connect to the JSON database service on
  port 10088 of your BBS server.  If you're not already running the JSON DB
  service, add the following section to /sbbs/ctrl/services.ini:

  [JSON]
  Port = 10088
  Options = STATIC | LOOP
  Command = json-service.js

  To create a SyncWall database on your BBS' JSON service, add the following
  line to /sbbs/ctrl/json-service.ini:

  syncwall=../xtrn/syncwall
  
  Recycle services (or simply restart your BBS) for these changes to take
  effect.
  
  If you want other systems to be able to access your SyncWall database, tell
  the sysops to follow the instructions set out in section 3.1 of this file,
  substituting the hostname and port number accordingly.
