1) Introduction
---------------

SyncWall is an interBBS ANSI whiteboard (blackboard?) that allows users to
draw on a shared canvas simultaneously.  The canvas is reset once each
month.  When launched, SyncWall cycles through the current month's canvas'
history, quickly replaying its progress from a blank slate to its current
state.


2) Installation
---------------

SyncWall depends on several libraries that any fully up-to-date Synchronet
BBS installation should already have. If you don't already do this regularly,
back up your BBS and then grab the latest updates from CVS.

I'll assume that your copy of Synchronet is installed at /sbbs.  Bear that in
mind as you follow these instructions.

- In SCFG (/sbbs/exec/scfg, or BBS->Configure from the Synchronet Control
  Panel in Windows), select "External Programs" from the main menu.

- Select "Online Programs (Doors)"

- Select "Main" (or whichever of your program groups you feel is the best
  category to fit SyncWall into for your system.)

- Select "Available Online Programs..."

- Add a new item with the following details:

  Name: SyncWall
  Internal Code: SyncWall
  Command Line: ?/sbbs/xtrn/syncwall/syncwall.js
  Multiple Concurrent Users: Yes

- If you would like SyncWall to run during your logon or logoff process,
  select "Execute on Event" and select the appropriate event.  Set the
  "Execute on Event Only" option to yes only if you don't want SyncWall
  to appear in the list of available online programs after the user has
  logged in.

- Leave all other options at their default values. Hit ESC until SCFG exits,
  saving your changes when prompted


3) Host your own wall
---------------------

If you're not already running the JSON DB service, add the following section
to /sbbs/ctrl/services.ini:

[JSON]
Port = 10088
Options = STATIC | LOOP
Command = json-service.js

Add the following line to /sbbs/ctrl/json-service.ini:

syncwall=../xtrn/syncwall

Open /sbbs/xtrn/syncwall/syncwall.js in a text editor and change the line:

var server = "bbs.electronicchicken.com";

To point to your hostname. (If you set the port for the JSON service to
something other than 10088 in /sbbs/ctrl/services.ini, you'll also need
to change the port number on the following line.)

If you want other systems to be able to use your wall, be sure that external
hosts can connect to port 10088 of your BBS server, and tell the other sysops
to make the same changes to /sbbs/xtrn/syncwall.js that you just did.
