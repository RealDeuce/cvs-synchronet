; or process messages (e.g. e-mail, newsgroup articles, etc.) from external
; systems/networks.

; Messages received from any e-mail addresses or names listed in this file

; you will be able to filter that person using this file (either by name
; or by e-mail address).

; Each twit address or name must be on its own line.
; E-mail address should be in the "name@host.domain" format (without quotes).
; Synchronet .can-style wildcards are allowed (e.g. "spam@*").

; Blank lines and lines beginning with semicolons are ignored.
