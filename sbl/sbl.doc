Synchronet BBS List v1.36
=========================

Create the directory: SBL off of your Synchronet XTRN directory.
(Example: C:\SBBS\XTRN\SBL) 

Make sure SBL.EXE and SBL.CFG are in this directory.

Use an ASCII editor to edit the Synchronet BBS List config file (SBL.CFG) to 
your liking.

Under SCFG->External Programs->Online Programs->Main, hit INS and add 
Synchronet BBS List with the following configuration:

Name				Synchronet BBS List
Internal Code			SBL
Start-up Directory		..\XTRN\SBL
Command Line			SBL
Clean-up Command Line
Multiuser			Yes
Intercept I/O Interrupts	Yes
Shrink BBS			No
Modify User Data		No
BBS Data File Type		Synchronet    XTRN.DAT
Place Drop File In		Node Directory

SBL Utilities
=============

SBLPACK.EXE	Remove deleted entries to save disk space and speed up listings
SBL2TXT.EXE     Convert SBL listing to a text file

Networking the Synchronet BBS List
==================================

If you wish to link your SBL database with other Synchronet BBSs, you must
carry the Synchronet Data echo via DOVE-Net, FidoNet, or RIME and add
the following two events in SCFG->External Programs->Timed Events:

Internal Code			SMB2SBL
Start-up Directory		..\XTRN\SBL
Command Line			SMB2SBL %jSUBS\SYNCDATA SBL.DAB 
Execution Node			1
Execution Days			Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat
Execution Time			04:30
Requires Exclusive Execution	No
Force Users Off-line for Event	No

Internal Code			SBL2SMB
Start-up Directory		..\XTRN\SBL
Command Line			SBL2SMB SBL.DAB %jSUBS\SYNCDATA /S:SYN
Execution Node			1
Execution Days			Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat
Execution Time			04:31
Requires Exclusive Execution	No
Force Users Off-line for Event  No

Change "SYNCDATA" to the internal code of the Synchronet Data sub-board on
your BBS. We used SYNCDATA, since that is the example given in the Synchronet
manual for the DOVE-Net Synchronet Data sub-board internal code. It is okay
if you used a completely different internal code, as long as you specify that
code instead of "SYNCDATA" on the above command lines.

Make note that all networked SBL entries will be deleted from Vertrauen
(Home of the Synchronet BBS List) after 90 days unless the entry is
retransmitted in the message base or updated manually on Vertrauen in that
time. To cause a retransmission from your BBS, you must (U)pdate the entry
using SBL and then SBL2SMB will re-export it automatically next time it is run
(via Timed Event). (V)erified entries are not re-exported by SBL2SMB, only new
and updated entries. You can also create a BBS entry message by hand (not
using SBL). Download SBBSLIST.ZIP from Vertrauen for more details.

Source Code
===========

If you are a C programmer, you may find the included source code interesting
and/or useful as an example for writing your own XSDK and/or SMB utilities.

MAKEFILE is for use with Borland C++ v3.x or v4.x and the Synchronet XSDK
to create SBL.EXE. SBL.C and SBLDEFS.H must also in the current directory when
MAKE is run.

The SMB C library (SMB_120.ZIP) is required to compile SBL2SMB.C and SMB2SBL.C
(MAKE.BAT included to compile them).

SBL2TXT.C is included as an SBL.DAB to SBL.TXT converter.
