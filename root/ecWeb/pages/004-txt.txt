Text file

You can use a text file as a static page.

The first line of the file will be used as the page title.

The contents of a text file used as a static page will be output within a set
of &lt;pre&gt; tags.  This helps to preserve line breaks and other formatting
that relies on a monospace font.  The .textFile rules in your theme's style.css
can control certain aspects of the pre's style, such as width (for wrapping.)
If you'd prefer not to output the text file's contents within a &lt;pre&gt; and
keep it stylistically consistent with the rest of your site, uncomment the line:

//		print(h);

in ~pages.ssjs and comment out the line below it.

This file is saved at ~pages/004-txt.txt.  Please delete it once you've read
and understood it.
