Setup:
- Open index.html with a text editor and change parameters if necessary
- Upload this folder to your webspace
- Navigate your browser to index.html

Usage with SSL module:
The SSL module is in early beta stadium. Use lightIRC_SSL_TLSv1.swf to connect to TLSv1 servers. Check your server first, most are using SSL3.
You need to pass the parameters ssl=yes and port=6697 (most likely).
There are two seperate lightIRC swf files because the SSL library makes the file larger than normal.
