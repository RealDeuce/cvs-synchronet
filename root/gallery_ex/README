This is a sample set of simple photo gallery scripts.  This also serves as an
example of usage of webctrl.ini for custom error pages.

The pics directory contains subdirectories with .jpg files.

When the gallery is initially viewed, the custom 404 error handler in the thumbs
directory will generate a thumbnail for each picture assuming that ImageMagicks
convert utility is installed and is in your path.

Remove the access.ars file to allow public access to this dir.
