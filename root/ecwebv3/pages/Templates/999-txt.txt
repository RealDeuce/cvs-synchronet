Document Title

This is a text file.  It can contain whatever you want, but bear in mind that
the first line of the file will be used as its title in the "pages" sidebar
module.  If the first line of the file reads:

HIDDEN:Title

then it will not be shown in the list.  ("HIDDEN" will be removed from the
output when the page is displayed.)
