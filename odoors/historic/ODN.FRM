Essentially, the OpenDoors Distribution Network is a list of "official"
OpenDoors distribution sites that will be distributed with future
versions of OpenDoors, and anyone is welcome to participate. The idea
behind the "OpenDoors distribution network" is simply to make it easier
for you, the OpenDoors programmer, to obtain OpenDoors updates. While
the newest version of OpenDoors is always available from the OpenDoors
Support BBS, and often from any system carrying the "Programmer's
Distribution Network", most OpenDoors programmers would find it useful
to know of a system closer to them where the newest version of OpenDoors
is always available. Although I would like to be able to send the newest
version of OpenDoors to any support site, the cost of doing so
unfortunately makes this impossible. However, it is likely that you
would pick up the newest version of OpenDoors when it is available
anyhow, so this shouldn't really make any difference. So, if you are
interested in becoming an official OpenDoors distribution site, simply
fill in the form below, and send it to me, either electronically or by
conventional mail at one of the addresses listed at the end of this
file.
