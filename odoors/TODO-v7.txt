Features/Changes which will break the API and so must go into v7
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Do not pack the od_control structure in memory.  This is plain silly.
- Do not use the BOOL type in od_control or in any of the public functions.
  Using it causes problems with stuff that defines a BOOL as a different
  size.  For example, xpdev uses int as a BOOL whereas OpenDoors uses a char.
- Support telnet IAC escaping, add an item to the od_control struct to
  keep track of the current status of IAC escapes.
- Fix up the local display for Win32.  It's horribly slow currently.
  Possibly just dust of the DOS stuff and use ciolib?
- Make output functions take an optional position and attribute to cut down
  on small send()s.
- Audit for small send()s in general.
- Possibly improve the output thread and make *nix multi-threaded for block
  buffering ala Synchronet.
- Change to 24-line default.  This means fixing the personalities, and the
  screen stuff.
- Autodetect if passed handle is a socket (Like I did for MyCroft doors)
