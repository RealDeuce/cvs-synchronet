NOTE:	The command line contains an OPTIONAL argument 'INTERBBS'
		specifying whether the game is to operate in local
		or inter-BBS mode. To operate local only, remove the 
		argument from the command line, otherwise it will attempt
		to use the inter-BBS service, as described in INTERBBS.DOC.
		
NOTE:	It is recommended that you check frequently for updates 
		from the Synchronet CVS repository located at:
		
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/xtrn/starstocks/
		
		LINKS:

NOTE:	This program REQUIRES the associated service to be configured in order
		to run properly. See attached INTERBBS.DOC for help.
	
*****UPDATING YOUR LOCAL LIBRARIES******

Before you attempt to install the inter-BBS service, it is recommended that you
update your relative 'EXEC/' and 'EXEC/LOAD/' paths (typically '/SBBS/EXEC/' and '/SBBS/EXEC/LOAD/')
with the latest files from the Synchronet CVS repository at:
	
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/
	
	RECOMMENDED UPDATES:
	
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/funclib.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/calendar.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/timer.js
