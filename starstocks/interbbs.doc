*****CONNECTING A GAME TO AN INTER-BBS HOST******

There is a SERVER.INI file included with every inter-BBS JavaScript game.
If you wish to connect your BBS to an existing network, edit the file and 
put the appropriate hostname or IP address, and the port on which the network is 
operating (default: 10088)


*****UPDATING YOUR LOCAL LIBRARIES******

Before you attempt to install the inter-BBS service, it is recommended that you
update your relative 'EXEC/' and 'EXEC/LOAD/' paths
with the latest files from the Synchronet CVS repository at:
	
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/
	
	RECOMMENDED UPDATES:
	
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/layout.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/inputline.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/funclib.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/calendar.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/event-timer.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/clock.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/scrollbar.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/cvs.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/frame.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/tree.js
		
	NOTE:	Replace any outdated local copies with the latest release from the links.

*****SETTING UP INTER-BBS SERVICE WITH SYNCHRONET*****

If you wish to host your own inter-BBS service for others to connect to, you must edit 
the file SERVICES.INI in your relative 'CTRL/' path. You must also open whichever port you 
specify on your router to allow other systems to connect (and edit your local server.ini
files so that you connect to your service).

	Default SERVICES.INI text for the inter-BBS service:
	
		[JSON]
		Port = 10088
		Options = STATIC | LOOP
		Command = json-service.js

The inter-BBS features of this program require that the appropriate services be configured, 
and that all of your files are up to date. The following files are needed to operate 
this program in inter-BBS mode, and can be downloaded from the Synchronet CVS repository at:

	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/

		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/json-service.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/json-db.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/json-sock.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/ctrl/json-service.ini
	
	NOTE: 	Placing these files in their corresponding local equivalent locations
			will make configuration much easier.

[EXEC/LOAD/JSON-CHAT.JS]

	This handles all inbound/outbound chat messages, and packages them for delivery json client.
	
[EXEC/LOAD/JSON-DB.JS]
	
	This file acts as a JSON object database, which is used by JSON-SERVICE, but can be used 
	on the client side as well. 
	
[EXEC/LOAD/JSON-CLIENT.JS]

	This file is the gateway to the program's interbbs server. It contains the methods needed to 
	lock, unlock, read, write and delete objects from the server database.
	
[EXEC/JSON-SERVICE.JS]

	This file acts as an socket service. It contains the methods needed to lock, unlock,
	read, write and delete objects from the server database, and also accepts JSON-CLIENT connections
	and acts as the main source for all dynamic program data. The file also contains instructions for
	setting up a server.
	
[CTRL/JSON-SERVICE.INI]

	This file tells JSON-SERVICE.JS where a program's files are located.
	
	This file is critical for the service to operate properly. If you have installed the programs that 
	use this service to their default locations, no additional configuration should be required other 
	than to un-comment the lines corresponding with the games you wish to host.
	
[XTRN/<GAME_DIR>/SERVER.INI]

	This file should be located in the program's working directory, as it contains information for 
	the host and port the program will be connecting to. Deleting this file will cause
	your program not to function.
