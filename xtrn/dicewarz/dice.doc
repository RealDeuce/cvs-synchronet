This game was modelled after "Dice Wars" which is a web-interface strategy 
game involving dice, similar to Risk. 
	
The object of the game is to conquer the map by rolling dice against 
neighboring tiles. The game can be played by 4 to 7 players, and can 
be either 1 human player vs. all computer players, all human vs. human 
players, or a mix of humans and computers. 
	
While the settings can be adjusted, the default maximum dice per tile is 8, 
and the default maximum reserve dice is 30.

                  ####GAMEPLAY#### 

When it is your turn, you press "T" to start your turn, and then "A" to 
begin attacking. Use the arrow keys to move around the map, and the [ENTER] 
key to select a territory. It would make sense to not attack a tile when 
the odds are against you. You are not required to make an attack at all, 
and you can simply press "E" to end your turn immediately if you only wish 
to place reinforcements.

Example: 
  Attacking tile's dice: 2 (6 + 6)
  Defending tile's dice: 8 (6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6)
	
In this scenario, the highest possible roll you can get as the attacker is 
a 12, whereas the highest roll the defender can get is 48. You will most 
likely lose, and would be better off attacking somewhere else.

When rolling dice against another player, all ties go to the defender. 

If you win the dice roll, the defending tile becomes yours, and all but 
one of your dice are automatically moved to the tile. The remaining die 
is left behind on the tile from which you attacked.

When you are finished attacking press "E" to end your turn, and you will 
be given reinforcement dice equal to the largest number of CONNECTED 
tiles you possess. This creates a secondary objective in the game which 
is to connect as many of your tiles on board as possible, so as to get 
more reinforcements. These are placed randomly on your tiles. 

If all of your tiles have reached the maximum number of dice per tile, 
any remaining reinforcements will be added to a reserve, up to a maximum 
of 30 dice. These reserve dice will be placed at the end of your turn 
along with your regular reinforcements as needed, unless all of your 
territories are already full.

The game is over (for you) when you have either conquered all of the 
tiles on the board, or had all of your tiles taken over by other players.
