	This is a multi-player game that is a cross between a war game and
a space trading game.  Players compete against one another and are even
able to attack and kill each other.  You have a ship that can roam the
universe, from space port to space port trading metals, organics and equipment
to earn credits (money.)  Once you've earned some credits, you can buy
fighters or cargo holds.  With more cargo holds, you can carry more merchandise
and earn more credits.  With fighters, you can attack and destroy other
players' ships and steal cargo holds from them.  You can also defend a
space port (or a series of sectors and space ports) which will give you
exclusive trading and make even more credits.  The goal of this game is
simple:  to control the universe.

GETTING STARTED
     All you have to do to play this game is to log on.  The computer
will automatically recognize you and enter you in the game if there is
room for you.  If there isn't room for you, don't worry.  Old players
are often deleted and room should open up in several days. You should
also leave a message for the sysop telling him you want to play because
he might be able to delete an old player before his time to make room
for you.  When you start, the computer will give you a ship along with
some cargo holds and some fighters and you will be on your way to becoming
the most powerful person in the universe.

ONCE YOU'RE IN...
     Once you're in, the computer will remember everything you do.  If
you exit the game in the middle, or even hang up on the game, it will
remember what you did and and allow you to continue the next time you
decide to play.  You are allowed so many turns a day, and each time you
move from sector to sector or land at a space port, you lose one turn.
Unfortunately, how many turns you've used up is remembered.  If someone
has left some fighters to protect the sector, you have to fight off his
fighters before you you are allowed to do anything in that sector.  You
can also retreat at the cost of one fighter though.
     However, once you're in a sector, you can trade at space ports, take
or leave fighters within the sector to defend it, and even attack other
peoples' ships.  Every time you attack someone's ship, they will know
who did it.  This also goes for you; if someone kills your fighters, you
will know who did it.  So experiment!  Feel free to wipe someone out...
they might even return the favor.  Start a war!

THE CABAL
     You're not alone in the universe.  The evil Cabal, a race of warring
creatures, wander around seeking whom they can devour.  These evil warriors
dwell in a portion of the known universe and if you are mighty enough,
you can conquer them.  The Cabal exist for the sole purpose to annoy players,
but an outstanding Trade Wars player can actually defeat the Cabal and
receive 100,000 points!  Also, there is a bounty on the Cabal:
For every Cabal fighter you destroy, you will receive 100 points. 
But beware, these guys are tough.

ONCE YOU'RE IN A SECTOR      Once you're in a sector, there are several
things you can do.  The following is a list of available commands:

A - ATTACK
     This command allows your fighters to attack another player's ship
in the same sector.  When you attack another's ship, the computer will
ask you the number of fighters you want to use.  Then the computer will
do the fighting for you.  On every attack, someone will lose a fighter,
and there is a 50% chance it will be yours.  If you don't lose one, the
other guy will.  The computer will keep fighting until either you lose
that many fighters, or you wipe out all the other persons fighters.  Then
it will give you a total telling you how good (or bad) you did.  It is
possible to lose 500 fighters in one stroke, so be careful with this one.
If you kill off all the fighters protecting another player's ship, you
can attack the ship and salvage 1/4 of its cargo.

C - COMPUTER
     Each ship has an on-board computer.  It can be called from within
a sector.  The computer has four functions, a port report, a sector finder,
a ranking routine, and a radio message routine.  The port report will give 
the quantity of any unprotected port so you can immediately know where there 
is some good trading.  The computer will ask you for what sector the port 
is in.  Just enter the sector number.  For example, for Sol, enter a '1'.
If there isn't a port in that sector, or someone is protecting that port 
with fighters, the computer will respond with "No information available."
     The sector finder will tell you how to get to any sector you specify.
If you want to know how to get to another sector, run this program.  It
will tell you which sectors to take to get to the sector you want.  This
will be very useful until you get a map made.
     The ranking routine ranks all the players playing the game.  Along
side the player is his or her value in credits.  This includes everything,
including fighters dropped in sectors.  Note that a person who has been
killed has a value of zero.
     The last function is the Send message function.  You will be asked
for a 'search string'.. For instance if you wanted to send a message to
Chris Sherrick, you could input  Sherr  for the search string. Or you can
simply enter the persons full name.  Once you have located the proper 
player to send the message to, you will be given a space of 74 characters
to write your message in.

D - DISPLAY SECTOR
     This will give you info about the sector you are in.  It will tell
you the sector you are in, the name and class of any ports in the sector,
other players' ships and the the number of fighters protecting them, the
number of fighters protecting the sector and who they belong to, and what
sectors the warps lead to.  Note the difference between fighters protecting
the sector and the fighters accompanying ships.  The fighters protecting
the sector are the ones you have to fight in order to get into the sector.
The fighters accompanying the ships are the ones you have to destroy to
get to the other players' ships (using the 'A' command.)

F - TAKE OR LEAVE FIGHTERS
     This lets you leave fighters to defend a sector or take the ones
already there.  If there are fighters protecting a sector, no one can
enter that sector without defeating them.  The computer will ask you how
many fighters you want defending the sector.  Note: this is DEFENDING
THE SECTOR.  If you have some there already, and you enter a number less
than the number there, you will take the remaining fighters.  If you want
to leave three fighters in an empty sector, enter '3'.  If you have seven
fighters in a sector and want to take them all, enter '0'. (None will
be left defending the sector.)  If you have four fighters in a sector
and want to take three and leave one, enter '1' and the remaining three
will go with you.  You are not allowed to leave fighters in sectors 1-7.
Sectors 1-7 is the Union (the local government) and they don't like having
fighters in their presence.

G - GAMBLE
     Due to popular demand, a new command has been added: Gambling.  You
gamble with credits and have 50-50 odds.  Just type G when you're in a
sector.  Warning: DON'T BET ALL YOU CREDITS!  If you lose all your credits,
and you have empty cargo holds there is nothing you can do.  You just
have to wait until someone destroys you.

I - INFO ABOUT YOUR SHIP
     This command will give you information about your ship.  It will
tell you the sector you are in, the number of turns left, the number of
fighters in your fleet, the number of cargo holds on your ship and what
they contain, and how many credits you have.

L - LAND/CREATE A PLANET
     Planets are similar to ports, only they produce everything, and give
their merchandise away instead of bartering with them. If you <L>and in
a sector containing no planets you will be able to Create a planet. But
you will need 10,000 credits to do so. Sounds nice doesn't it?  
One thing you should know about planets is what productivity is.
Productivity is how many units that planet produces per 24 hours.  You can
 increase the productivity (by putting money into a planet)  
Planets start with an initial productivity of 1 in ore, organics,
and equipment.  They have a maximum productivity of 20 each.  I highly
recommend leaving fighters in a sector with a planet in it because it
doesn't cost a thing to destroy a planet.  All you have to do is land
at it.  There is one planet allowed per sector.

M - MOVE
     This allows you to move from sector to sector.  The Union has established
a web of warps from sector to sector that you can travel through.  Each
move takes up one turn and you have a limited number of turns a day. 
If you move into a sector with fighters protecting it, you will have to
fight them before you can enter.  You can attack or retreat.  If you retreat,
you will return to the sector from which you came from, but you won't
use up another turn.  It will cost you one fighter to retreat and if you
don't have one left, there is a 50% chance you will make it.

P - PORT
     This command allows you to land and trade with space ports, providing
there is one in your sector.  Docking at a space port uses up one turn
When you trade, you trade in units.  One unit is enough to fill one cargo
hold aboard your ship.  There are three types of merchandise: ore, organics
(org.), and equipment (eqp.) Each port has a class that determines what
it will sell and buy.  A class 1 port sells eqp. and buys everything else. 
A class 2 port sells organics and buys everything else, and a class 3
port sells ore and buys everything else.  When you dock, you will haggle
over the prices.  They will give you an offer, and you will counter offer. 
This will continue until either they take your offer, or decide to go
elsewhere to do business.  The prices depend on how much they have or
need.  The more they have or need, the better the bargain.  Ports produce
a limited amount of merchandise a day. If you can capture one with fighters,
don't trade with it for several days and let the prices get better and
better.  How much of a bargain varies from port to port.  Sol (in sector
1) is a special port.  It sells fighters, cargo holds, and turns.  When
you buy turns, they are a temporary one shot deal; you buy turns, not
the number of turns allotted per day. These prices of fighters and cargo
holds vary depending on what day of the week it is; you don't haggle over
these prices.

Q - QUIT GAME
     This command allows you to quit the game and return to the BBS. 
You can also hang up, but I would rather have you simply Quit.  
It makes sure that nothing is going to go wrong.  If you quit and
you haven't used up all your turns, you can come back later on and continue
with your remaining turns.

T - TEAM MENU
     Entering T will get you the Team menu.  This menu consists of Six
separate functions. If you don't belong to a team, only three options are
visible. At the team menu prompt you can enter '2' to create a Team, you
will be asked for a Team password (which will be needed by other players
to join your team).. That is basically it to creating a Team. Note: when
you create a team, you do not need to join it afterwards. The next function,
'3', is Join a Team.  You will be asked for the Team number you wish to 
join, and if a spot is open on that team, you will be asked for the team
password. If you enter the correct password, you are then recorded as a 
member of that Team. Command '4' is the Quit a team command. You will need
to quit a team if you want to create a new team or join another one.
     If you are a member of a team, you will have 3 more functions. '5' is
the Transfer credit command. You can transfer your credits to a Team member.
(as long as they are in the same sector as yourself) Note: you cannot 
transfer credits FROM a team mate to yourself. Entering '6' will give you
the Fighter Transfer option. This works in the exact same manner as the
credit transfer function, only with fighters. The last Team function is
the Locate team mates command, '7'. This will give you a list of Team mates
and the sector they are located in, if any.

? - HELP!
     This command will give you a list of the commands you can use.

Z - INSTRUCTIONS
     This will reprint these instructions.

     This is all there is to the game.  Play it and have fun!                                                                       
