*****UPDATING YOUR LOCAL LIBRARIES******

Before you attempt to install the inter-BBS service, it is recommended that you
update your relative 'EXEC/' and 'EXEC/LOAD/' paths
with the latest files from the Synchronet CVS repository at:
	
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/
	
	RECOMMENDED UPDATES:
	
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/funclib.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/calendar.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/timer.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/clock.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/msgwndw.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/scrollbar.js
		
	NOTE:	Replace any outdated local copies with the latest release from the links.

*****SETTING UP INTER-BBS SERVICE WITH SYNCHRONET*****

The inter-BBS features of this program require that the appropriate services be configured, 
and that all of your files are up to date. The following files are needed to operate 
this program in inter-BBS mode, and can be downloaded from the Synchronet CVS repository at:

	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/

		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/commservice.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/commclient.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/chateng.js
		http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/ctrl/filesync.ini
	
	NOTE: 	Placing these files in their corresponding local equivalent locations
			will make configuration much easier.

[COMMSERVICE.JS]

	This is a static service that must be included in /ctrl/services.ini in order to 
	accept connections and relay information to and from the main hub. It is critical
	for this to be set up properly, for the programs that depend on it will not function
	properly without it.

	This file must be placed in your relative 'EXEC/' or 'MODS/' path (typically '/SBBS/EXEC/').
	Once the file is in place, you must add the following to your 'CTRL/SERVICES.INI' file:

		[Commserv]
		Port=10088
		Options=STATIC
		Command=commservice.js bbs.thebrokenbubble.com 10088

	NOTE:	there are two arguments on the command line that tell the service the address and 
			port of the main hub, which by default is the Broken Bubble BBS, on port 10088. If
			you wish to act as your own hub (e.g. start your own league), simple remove both
			arguments from the command line, and direct league nodes to add your URL and port
			to their SERVICES.INI file. If your system operates on multiple machines and you wish 
			to share data between local nodes ONLY, setting up this service as a hub makes
			this possible as well.

	NOTE:	You should also double check to make sure that your services are running

[COMMCLIENT.JS]

	This is the dedicated client that connects to the inter-BBS service. This file handles
	the transmission of data to and from the service, as well as managing file synchronization
	for the client (this program). This file is critical for the successful operation of this program 
	in inter-BBS mode.
	
	The file must be placed in your relative 'EXEC/LOAD/' path.
	There is no further setup required for this to work (unless you changed the default 'Port' setting for the service 
	in SERVICES.INI). 

[CHATENG.JS]

	This handles all inbound/outbound chat messages, and packages them for delivery via the client and service.
	this also contains the necessary objects to implement a chat room (windowed or fullscreen). 
	
	NOTE:	while this particular program may not have chat features, the service itself still may
			require this file to be present.
	
[FILESYNC.INI]

	This file tells FILESYNC.JS and COMMCLIENT.JS where to store/retrieve inbound/outbound transfers
	coming from the client and the service. 
	
	This file is critical for the service to operate properly. If you have installed the programs that 
	use this service to their default locations, no additional configuration should be required.
	
[SERVER.INI]

	This file should be located in the program's working directory, as it contains information for 
	the host, port, and any "auth" the program's server might require. Deleting this file will cause
	your program to function either as local-only, or as a server itself, depending on your setup
	within the gaming service.
