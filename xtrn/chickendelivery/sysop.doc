1) JSON Database Setup

To connect to the inter-BBS scoreboard, create a 'server.ini' file in your
'xtrn/chickendelivery/' directory containing the following:

host = bbs.electronicchicken.com
port = 10088

Or, if you wish to host your own scoreboard, you must add the following to
your 'ctrl/json-service.ini' file:

[chickendelivery2]
dir=../xtrn/chickendelivery/

And ensure that the JSON service is enabled in your 'ctrl/services.ini' file:

[JSON]
Port=10088
Options=STATIC|LOOP
Command=json-service.js
