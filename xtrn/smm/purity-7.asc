Section 7:  Alternate Choices.  26 questions.

      For any of the questions in this section, a yes answer is in order if it
      is something that you do as an alternative to other sexual gratifications
      or as an aid and/or in conjunction with other means of sexual
      gratification.  In other words, have you done it in a serious basis?
      Trying it a few times to see what it's like does not count.
