ENFPs in short:

Warmly enthusiastic, high-spirited, ingenious, imaginative.  Able
to do almost anything that interests them.  Quick with a solution
for any difficulty and ready to help anyone with a problem.  Often
rely on their ability to improvise instead of preparing in advance.
Can usually find compelling reasons for whatever they want.

About 5% of the population.

Details on ENFPs:

For ENFPs nothing occurs which does not have some significance, and
they have an uncanny sense of the motivations of others.  This
gives them a talent for seeing life as an exciting drama, pregnant
with possibilities for both good and evil.  This type is found in
only about 5 percent of the general population, but they have great
influence because of their extraordinary impact on others.

ENFPs strive toward the authentic, even when acting spontaneously,
and this intent is usually communicated nonverbally to others, who
find this characteristic attractive.  ENFPs, however, find their
own efforts of authenticity and spontaneity always lacking, and
tend to heap coals of fire on themselves, always berating
themselves for being so conscious of self.

ENFPs consider intense emotional experiences vital; when they have
these, however, they are made uneasy by a sense of being there but
with a part of themselves cut off.  They strive for congruency, but
always see themselves in some danger of losing touch with their
real feelings, which ENFPs possess in a wide range and variety.

ENFPs exercise a continuous scanning of the external environment
and nothing out of the ordinary is likely to escape their
attention.  They are keen and penetrating observers and are capable
of intense concentration on another individual while aware of what
is going on about them.  Their attention is never passive or
casual, never wandering, but always directed.

At times, ENFPs find themselves interpreting events in terms of
another's "hidden motive," giving special meaning to words or
actions.  This interpretation tends to be negative and, more often
than not, inaccurately negative.  In the process, an ENFP may find
that he or she has introduced an unnecessary, toxic element into
the relationship.

While ENFPs are brilliantly perceptive, they can make serious
mistakes in judgement, which works to their discomfort.  These
mistakes derive from their tendency to focus on data which confirm
their own biases.  They may be absolutely correct in their
perceptions but wrong in their conclusions.

Because they tend to be hypersensitive and hyperalert, they may
suffer from muscle tension.  They live in readiness for
emergencies; because they have this facility, they assume this is
true for others.  They can become bored rather quickly with both
situations and people, and resist repeating experiences.

They enjoy the process of creating something - an idea or a project
- but are not as interested in the follow-through.  They are
typically enthusiastic, and this is contagious.  People get caught
up and entranced by an ENFP.  Yet this type is marked with a fierce
independence, repudiating any kind of subordination, either in
themselves or in others in relation to them.

They do tend to attribute more power to authority figures than is
there and give over to these figures an ability to "see through"
them - which also is not apt to be there.

While ENFPs resist the notion of others becoming dependent or
having power over them, their charisma draws followers who wish to
be shown the way.  ENFPs constantly find themselves surrounded by
others who look toward the ENFP for wisdom, inspiration, courage,
leadership, and so on - an expectancy which, at times, weighs
rather heavily on an ENFP.

ENFPs are characteristically optimistic and are surprised when
people and events do not turn out as anticipated.  Often their
confidence in the innate goodness of fate and human nature is a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

ENFPs have a remarkable latitude in career choices and succeed in
many fields.  As workers, they are warmly enthusiastic, high
spirited, ingenious, imaginative, and can do almost anything that
interests them.  They can solve most problems, particularly those
dealing with people.  They are charming and at ease with
colleagues; others enjoy their presence.

ENFPs are outstanding in getting people together, and are good at
initiating meetings and conferences, although not as talented at
providing for the operational details of these events.  They enjoy
inventing new ways of doing things, and their projects tend to
become a cause, quickly becoming personalized.

They are imaginative themselves, but can have difficulty picking up
on ideas and projects initiated by others.  They must make these
ideas and projects their own if ENFPs are to lend energy and
interest.  Once people or projects become routine, ENFPs are likely
to lose interest; what 'might be' is always more fascinating than
'what is.'

ENFPs make extensive use of their intuitive powers.  They usually
have a wide range of personal and telephone contacts, expending
energy in maintaining both career and personal relationships.

ENFPs make excellent salespeople, advertising people, politicians,
screen or play writers, and in general are attracted to the
interpretive arts, particularly, character acting.
People-to-people work is essential for ENFPs, who need the feedback
of interaction with others.

ENFPs may find it difficult to work within the constraints of an
institution, especially in following rules, regulations, and
standard operating procedures.  More frequently, institutional
procedures and policies are targets to be challenged and bent by
the will of an ENFP.  Colleagues and superiors sometimes find
themselves in the position of having to accommodate and salvage.

At times, ENFPs demonstrate impatience with others; they may get
into difficulty in an organization by siding with its detractors,
who find in an ENFP a sympathetic ear and a natural rescuer.  In
occupational choice, ENFPs quickly become restless if the choice
involves painstaking detail and follow-through over a period of
time.  Variety in day-to-day operations and interactions best suits
the talents of ENFPs, who need quite a bit of latitude in which to
exercise their adaptive ingenuity.

As mates, ENFPs tend to be charming, gentle, sympathetic, and
nonconformist.  They are not likely to be interested in the
less-inspired routines of daily maintenance and ever will be
seeking new outlets for their inspirations.

As parents, ENFPs are devoted to their children, shifting from a
role of "friend in need rescuer" to stern authority figure.  They
may not always be willing to enforce their impulsive
pronouncements, but leave it to their mates to follow through.

A mate of an ENFP can expect charming surprises: extravagant
generosity punctuated by periods of frugality.  Independent actions
regarding money on the part of an ENFP's mate are not ordinarily
welcomed, and the mate may find him or herself in an embarrassing
situation of having to return purchases.

ENFPs generally are the ones in charge of the home, and a
conflict-free home is desired, almost demanded.  When he or she is
in charge of economic resources, the ENFPs may contain extravagant
luxuries, while necessities may be missing.  They are not always
interested in saving for the future and may be casual in giving
consideration to such things as life insurance, savings accounts,
and even a ready cash supply for mate and children.

ENFPs are characteristic in their pursuit of the novel, their
strong sense of the possible, and outstanding intuitive powers.  At
the same time, they have warmth and fun with people and generally
are unusually skilled in handling people.  Their extroverted role
tends to be well developed, as is their capacity for the novel and
the dramatic.
