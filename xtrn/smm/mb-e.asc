An Extrovert is energized by people. A strong extrovert feels very much alone
without lots of people around. E's tend to talk first & think later, know a
lot of people, don't mind having a conversation while the TV is on, are
approachable, don't consider the telephone to be an interruption, tend to 
think out loud and use people as a sounding board for their ideas, need
affirmation from friends about  who I am & how do I look. 
About 75% of the population are type E.
