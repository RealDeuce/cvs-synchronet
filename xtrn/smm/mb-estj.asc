ESTJs in short:

Practical, realistic, matter-of-fact, with a natural head for
business or mechanics.  Not interested in subjects they see no use
for, but can apply themselves when necessary.  Like to organize and
run activities.  May make good administrators, especially if they
remember to consider others' feelings and points of view.

About 13% of the population.

Details about ESTJs:

ESTJs are very much in touch with the external environment.  They
know their community and usually are pillars of strength.  The best
adjective to describe ESTJs would be 'responsible.'  They represent
about 13 percent of the general population.

ESTJs are outstanding at organizing procedures and in detailing
rules and regulations.  They like to see things done correctly.
They tend to be impatient with those who do not carry out
procedures with sufficient attention to those details, prescribed
by those with the most experience, that will get the job done
right.

ESTJs are comfortable in evaluating others and tend to judge how a
person is doing in terms of standard operating procedures.  They
may, at times, be abrupt with those who do not follow the rules
correctly.  ESTJs are realistic, matter-of-fact, and more curious
about new devices and processes than about new principles and
theories.

ESTJs generally are loyal to their institutions, work, and
community and make excellent, faithful mates and parents.  They see
where their duty lies and are not likely to shirk the doing of that
duty, even when this requires considerable sacrifice on their part.

They frequently rise to positions of responsibility in their jobs,
in the community, and in their religious affiliations.  They very
often belong to several civic clubs and support them both through
steady attendance and through their spoken attitudes.  ESTJs
themselves are punctual and expect others to be also.

ESTJs may not always be responsive to points of view and emotions
of others and may have a tendency to jump to conclusions too
quickly at times.  They may not always be willing to listen
patiently to opposing views; they are especially vulnerable to this
tendency when in positions of authority.  They may need to make
special effort to remain open to input from others who are
dependent on them - their children, spouses, and employees.

ESTJs are so in tune with the established, time-honored
institutions and ways of behaving within those institutions that
they cannot understand those who might wish to abandon or radically
change those institutions.  They follow routines well at home and
at work, tending to have a place for everything and wanting
everything in its place.  They are usually neat and orderly at work
and at play.

They approach human relations through traditions and rituals,
promoting harmony and contentment in their relationships through
creating well-worked-out routines and procedures.  Family
traditions have meaning for ESTJs, and they willingly participate
in observing these.  They enjoy opportunities to see friends,
former colleagues, and relatives at functions such as retirement
dinners, annual picnics, Thanksgiving gatherings, and weddings.

ESTJs are relatively easy to get to know; they do not tend to
confuse people by sending double messages.  They are dependable and
consistent, and what they seem to be is what they are.
