INTPs in short:

Quiet, reserved, impersonal.  Enjoy especially theoretical or
scientific subjects.  Logical to the point of hairsplitting.
Usually interested mainly in ideas, with little liking for parties
or small talk.  Tend to have sharply defined interests.  Need
careers where some strong interest can be used and useful.

About 1% of the population.

Details on INTPs:

INTPs exhibit the greatest precision in thought and language of all
the types; they tend to see the distinctions and inconsistencies in
thought and language instantaneously.  The one word which captures
the unique style of INTPs is 'architect' - the architect of ideas
and systems as well as the architect of edifices.  This type is
found in only 1 percent of the population and therefore is not
encountered as frequently as some of the other types.

INTPs detect contradictions in statements no matter how distant in
space or time the contradictory statements were produced.  The
intellectual scanning of INTPs has a principled quality; that is,
INTPs search for whatever is relevant and pertinent to the issue at
hand.  Consequently, INTPs can concentrate better than any other
type.

Authority derived from office, position, or wide acceptance does
not impress INTPs.  External authority per se is irrelevant.  INTPs
abhor redundancy and incoherence.

Possessing a desire to understand the universe, an INTP is
constantly looking for natural law.  Curiosity concerning these
keys to the universe is a driving force in this type.

INTPs prize intelligence in themselves and in others, but can
become intellectual dilettantes as a result of their need to amass
ideas, principles, or understanding of behavior.  And once they
know something, it is remembered.

INTPs can become obsessed with analysis.  Once caught up in a
thought process that thought process seems to have a will of its
own for INTPs, and they persevere until the issue is comprehended
in all its complexity.  They can be intellectual snobs and may show
impatience at times with others less endowed intellectually.  This
quality, INTPs find, generates hostility and defensive behaviors on
the part of others, who may describe an INTP as arrogant.

For INTPs, the world exists primarily to be understood.  Reality is
trivial, a mere arena for proving ideas.  It is essential that the
universe is understood and that whatever is stated about the
universe is stated correctly, with coherence and without
redundancy.  This is the INTP's final purpose.  It matters not
whether others understand or accept his or her truths.

The INTP is the logician, the mathematician, the philosopher, the
scientist; any pursuit requiring architecture of ideas intrigues
this type.

INTPs should not, however, be asked to work out the implementation
of application of their models to the real world.  The INTP is the
architect of a system and leaves it to others to be the builder and
the applicator.  Very often, therefore, the INTP's work is not
credited to him or her.  The builder and the applier gains fame and
fortune, while the INTP's name remains obscure.  Appreciation of an
INTP's theoretical work frequently comes posthumously - or the work
may never be removed from library shelves at all and thus lost.

INTPs tend not to be writers or to go into sales work.  They are,
however, often excellent teachers, particularly for advanced
students, although INTPs do not always enjoy much popularity, for
they can be hard taskmasters.

They are not good at clerical tasks and are impatient with routine
details.  They prefer to work quietly, without interruption, and
often alone.  If an organization is to use the talents of an INTP
appropriately, the INTP must be given an efficient support staff
who can capture ideas as they emerge and before the INTP loses
interest and turns to another idea.

INTPs take their mating relationship seriously and usually are
faithful and devoted - albeit preoccupied at times.  They are not
likely to welcome constant social activity or disorganization in
the home.

In all probability, the mate of an INTP will initiate and manage
the social life.  If left to his or her own devices, the INTP mate
will retreat into the world of books and emerge only when physical
needs become imperative.

INTPs are, however, willing, compliant, and easy to live with,
although somewhat forgetful of appointments, anniversaries, and the
rituals of daily living - unless reminded.  They may have
difficulty expressing their emotions verbally, and the mate of an
INTP may believe that he/she is somewhat taken for granted.

As a parent, the INTP is devoted; they enjoy children and are
serious about their upbringing.  The home of an INTP parent is
usually calm, low-key in discipline, but well run and ordered.

INTPs deal with the environment primarily through intuition, and
their strongest quality, the thinking function, remains relatively
hidden except in close associations.  Therefore, INTPs are often
misunderstood, seen as difficult to know, and seldom perceived at
their true level of competency.

They are inclined to be shy except with close friends, and their
reserve is difficult to penetrate.  They are very adaptable until
one of their principles is violated.  Then INTPs are not adaptable
at all!

They may have difficulty in being understood by others because they
tend to think in a complicated fashion and want to be precise,
never redundant in their communications.

Because their feeling qualities may be underdeveloped, they may be
insensitive to the wants and wishes of others, often quiet unaware
of the existence of these wants and wishes.
