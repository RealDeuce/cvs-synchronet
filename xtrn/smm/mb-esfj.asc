ESFJs in short:

Warmhearted, talkative, popular, conscientious, born cooperators,
active committee members.  Need harmony and may be good at creating
it.  Always doing something nice for someone.  Work best with
encouragement and praise.  Little interest in abstract thinking or
technical subjects.  Main interest is in things that directly and
visibly affect people's lives.

About 13% of the population.

Details about ESFJs:

ESFJs, the most sociable of all the types, are energized by
interactions with people, tending to idealize whatever or whoever
they admire.  'Harmony' is a key to this type, which is represented
in about 13 percent of the general population.

ESFJs are the great nurturers of established institutions such as
the home, the school, the church, and civic groups.  Wherever they
go, they promote harmony and harmonious relationships.  They are
outstanding hosts or hostesses, able to call people by name,
usually after one introduction.  At a social gathering they can be
observed attending to the needs of others, trying to insure that
all are comfortable and involved.

Social ties matter to the ESFJs, and their conversations often
drift to the nostalgic recounting of past memories.  Traditions are
developed, supported, and carefully observed by the ESFJ.

ESFJs are hurt by indifference and need to be appreciated both for
themselves and for the abundance, typically in the form of
services, they give to others.  They are conscious of appearances
and take the opinions of others regarding social standards very
seriously.  Values in an ESFJ may take the form of 'shoulds' and
'should nots' and may be freely expressed.  Conscientious and
orderly, ESFJs may become restless when isolated from people.

Career selection by ESFJs may lean toward service occupations.
They have such outgoing personalities that they are outstanding at
selling, being an invariable winner in sales contests.  They are
apt to have seniority in any sales group within an organization.
Observation of ESFJs at work in a sales transaction will
demonstrate how this type personalizes the sale: The customer is
not buying the product; he or she is buying personally from the
ESFJ.

This same characteristic causes ESFJs to be good in teaching,
preaching, supervision, administration, coaching, and, in general,
people-to-people jobs.  They seldom become a source of irritation
to their superiors, for they respect and obey the rules and
regulations, are duty and service oriented.  They are loyal to
their bosses.

ESFJs are likely to be aware of and enjoy discussing events and
problems in the lives of their colleagues; but when conversations
turn to abstractions of philosophy or science, the ESFJ may become
restive.  Analysis of the complex - for example, an attempt to find
an explanation of events through an analysis of principles - does
not excite their interest, as it does the NTs.

ESFJ mates have a set of values which contain clear 'shoulds' and
'should-nots', and they expect their family to abide by these.
They are conscientious about home responsibilities, are orderly
about the home, and prefer that other occupants be the same.  They
enjoy socializing and entertaining.

ESFJs want family decisions settled efficiently and quickly and
want family living routinized, scheduled, and correctly executed.
They do not rebel against routine operations, and are devoted to
the traditional values of home and hearth, respect their marriage
vows, and are the most sympathetic of all types.

They tend to be dependent on their mates and may marry to insure
that they have a proper place in the social strata.  They enjoy the
rituals in connected with serving of good food and beverages,
thrive on festive occasions, respect and accumulate a goodly store
of material possessions.  They take their role in the community
seriously and are sensitive to the acknowledged, official
decision-makers and identify with them.  They are aware of status,
and often depend on higher authority as the source of opinions and
attitudes.

ESFJs wear their hearts on their sleeves and are outgoing in their
emotional reactions.  They need to be needed, loved, and
appreciated and may spend much energy reassuring themselves that
this is the case.  They can become melancholy and depressed and
even suicidal if they take the blame for whatever might be wrong in
their institution or their personal relationships - as they are
prone to do.

ESFJs usually respect and revere their parents, and as children
were responsive and obedient pupils.  They seem able to express the
right feeling for a given situation.

They are softhearted, sentimental, and usually observe with gusto
and a flourish birthdays, anniversaries, and the like, making of
the event a delightful, important occasion.  At the same time,
however, ESFJs can cause others undue tension by expressing
anticipations of gloom and doom, exhibiting a bent toward the
pessimistic that can be contagious.  They need to control their
fears that the worst is sure to happen and suppress their tendency
toward crepe-hanging and anticipating disasters.

The children of an ESFJ are seen as an extension of the family, and
all they do reflects on the ESFJ.  If things do not go well, the
SFJ may be critical, even carping toward his or her mate and
children.

This type may marry alcoholics or others who are particularly
needy.  If a female ESFJ is married to a mate who is not a good
provider, she can become nagging and brood over a comparison of her
possessions and status with that of others.

ESFJs, male or female, live in terms of people and things rather
than in terms of ideas and principles.  They enjoy the process of
decision-making, particularly when focus is on the 'usefulness' of
things and people.
