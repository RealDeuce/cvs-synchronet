INFJs in short:

Succeed by perseverance, originality and desire to do whatever is
needed or wanted.  Put their best efforts into their work.  Quietly
forceful, conscientious, concerned for others.  Respected for their
firm principles.  Likely to be honored and followed for their clear
convictions as to how best to serve the common good.

About 1% of the population.

Details about INFJs:

INFJs focus on possibilities, think in terms of values, and come
easily to decisions.  The small number of this type (1 percent) is
regrettable, since INFJs have an unusually strong drive to
contribute to the welfare of others and genuinely enjoy helping
their fellow men.  This type has great depth of personality; they
are themselves complicated, and can understand and deal with
complex issues and people.

It is an INFJ who is likely to have visions of human events past,
present, or future.  If a person demonstrates an ability to
understand psychic phenomenon better than most others, this person
is likely to be an INFJ.

Characteristically, INFJs have strong empathetic abilities and can
be aware of another's emotions or intents even before that person
is conscious of these.  This can take the form of feeling the
distress or illnesses of others to an extent which is difficult for
other types.  INFJs can intuit good and evil in others, although
they seldom can tell how they came to know.  Subsequent events tend
to bear them out, however.

INFJs are usually good students, achievers who exhibit an
unostentatious creativity.  They take their work seriously and
enjoy academic activity.  They can exhibit qualities of
over-perfectionism and put more into a task than perhaps is
justified by the nature of the task.  They generally will not be
visible leaders, but will quietly exert influence behind the
scenes.

INFJs are hard to get to know.  They have an unusually rich inner
life, but they are reserved and tend not to share their reactions
with those they trust.  Because of their vulnerability through a
strong facility to interject, INFJs can be hurt rather easily by
others, which, perhaps, is at least one reason they tend to be
private people.  People who have known an INFJ for years may find
sides emerging which come as a surprise.  Not that INFJs are
inconsistent; they are very consistent and value integrity.  But
they have convoluted, complex personalities which sometimes puzzle
even them.

INFJs like to please others and tend to contribute their best
efforts in all situations.  They prefer and enjoy agreeing with
others, and find conflict disagreeable and destructive.  What is
known as ESP is likely found in an INFJ.

INFJs have vivid imaginations exercised both as memory and
intuition, and this can amount to genius, resulting at times in an
INFJs being seen as mystical.  This unfettered imagination often
will enable this person to compose complex and often aesthetic
works of arts such as music, mathematical systems, poems, plays,
and novels.  In a sense the INFJ is the most poetic of all the
types.  INFJs can have uncanny communications with certain
individuals at a distance.

INFJs often select liberal arts as a college major and opt for
occupations which involve interacting with people, but on a
one-to-one basis.  For example, the general practitioner in
medicine might be an INFJ, or the psychiatrist or psychologist.  As
with all NFs, the ministry holds attraction, although the INFJ must
develop an extroverted role here which requires a great deal of
energy.

INFJs may be attracted to writing as a profession, and often they
use language which contains an unusual degree of imagery.  They are
masters of the metaphor, and both their verbal and written
communications tend to be elegant and complex.  Their great talent
for language usually is directed toward people, describing people
and writing to communicate with people in a personalized way. INFJs
who write comment often that they write with a particular person in
mind; writing to a faceless abstract audience leaves them
uninspired.

INFJs make outstanding individual therapists who have the ability
to get in touch with the archetypes of their patients in a way some
other types do not.  The INFJs are also the most vulnerable of all
types to the eruptions of their own archetypal material.  As
therapists, INFJs may choose counseling, clinical psychology, or
psychiatry, or may choose to teach in these fields.  Writing about
these professions often intrigues an INFJ.

Whatever their choice, they generally are successful in these
fields because of their great personal warmth, their enthusiasm,
their insight, their depth of concentration, their originality, and
their organizational skills can all be brought into play.

At work as well as socially, INFJs are highly sensitive in their
handling of others and tend to work well in an organizational
structure.  They have a capacity for working at jobs which require
solitude and concentration, but also do well when in contact with
people, providing the human interaction is not superficial.

INFJs enjoy problem-solving and can understand and use human
systems creatively and humanistically.  As employees and employers,
INFJs are concerned with people's feelings and are able to provide
in themselves a barometer of the feelings of individuals and groups
within the organization.  INFJs listen well and are  willing and
able to consult and cooperate with others.  Once a decision is
made, they work to implement it.

INFJs are usually good at public relations and themselves have good
interpersonal relations.  They value staff harmony and want an
organization to run smoothly and pleasantly, themselves making
every effort to contribute to that end.

They are crushed by too much criticism and can have their feelings
hurt rather easily.  They respond to praise and use approval as a
means of motivating others, just as they, the INFJs, are motivated
by approval.  If they are subject to a hostile, unfriendly working
condition or to constant criticism, they tend to lose confidence,
become unhappy and immobilized, and finally become physically ill.

As mates INFJs are devoted to their spouses, but may not always be
open to physical approaches.  They tend to be physically
demonstrative at times, but wish to choose when, which is when they
are in the mood.  This may be quite confusing to an extroverted
mate.

Often an INFJs expressions of affection will be subtle, taking a
humorous, unexpected turn.  INFJs need and want harmony in their
home and find constant conflict, overt or covert, extremely
destructive to their psyches.  Their friendship circle is likely to
be small, deep, and longstanding.

As parents, INFJs usually are fiercely devoted.  A female INFJ,
particularly, is linked to her children in a way different from the
other types: with almost a psychic symbiosis.  This deep bond can
create an overdependency that can be unhealthy for both mother and
child.  At the same time, INFJs tend to be good friends with their
children, while firm in discipline.  They usually are concerned
about the comfort of a home and most especially the comfort,
physical health, and emotional well-being of both mates and
children.
