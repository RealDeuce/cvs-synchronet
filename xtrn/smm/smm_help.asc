yhOverall Match (General Explanation):nc

The overal match is a highly refined algorithm used to compute a percentage of 
preference match between a user and a prospective mate. The user's preferences
are weighed more heavily than those of the prospective mate. More specific
preferences will result in a higher match percentage potential and a wider
range of match percentages. More vague preferences will result in a rather
narrow range of match percentages, so it is best to keep your "hideal matenc" 
in mind when completing the preferred mate sections of your profile and
questionnaires.

yhGlobal Database:nc

If your sysop has taken the steps to link this profile database with the 
international hSyncDatanc network, your profile will be automatically included
in this global database for users on other BBSs around the world to view. The 
profiles you see in this database may very well be users in other counties, 
states, or countries and you can view their information here and communicate
with them via hTelegramnc using this program.
