ISTPs in short:

Cool-onlookers - quiet, reserved, observing and analyzing life with
detached curiosity and unexpected flashes of original humor.
Usually interested in impersonal principles, cause and effect, how
and why mechanical things work.  Exert themselves no more than they
think necessary, because any waste of energy would be inefficient.

About 13% of the population.

Details about ISTPs:

Just as impulsive as other SPs, the ISTP's life is artful action -
and action is end in itself.  Action for the ISTP is more
gratifying if it is born of impulse rather than purpose.  If the
action is in the service of an end or aim, let the aim look out for
itself; it cannot be allowed to influence execution.  The act is
self-directed, self-leading, containing its own imperatives which
cannot be suborned to mere rules, regulations, or laws.

ISTPs are egalitarian and can be fiercely loyal to "brothers." They
can also be fiercely insubordinate seeing hierarchy and authority
as unnecessary and even superfluous.  It is not so much a matter of
going against regulations as it is simply ignoring them.

The ISTP must do his or her own thing, free to vary each next move.
And ISTPs are, or want to be, proud of their ability to make the
next move skillfully.

ISTPs are often fearless, risking themselves more than other types,
despite (even frequent) injury.  Of all the types, ISTPs are most
likely to pit themselves, or their technique, against chance, odds,
or fate.  They thrive on excitement; they crave some excitement
each day, in the form of fast motion - racing, sky diving, or
surfing, for instance.  This hunger for action makes them much more
subject to boredom than any other type, their urge driving them to
a faster pace.  Strangely, however, they are not bored while doing
their thing, even though there may be long stretches when nothing
happens, as during travel, surfing, hunting, or fishing.

The ISTP nature is most easily seen in their mastery of tools,
tools of any kind, from microscopic drill to supersonic jet.  From
an early age, they are drawn to tools as to a magnet; they must
manipulate them, and tools fall into their hands demanding use.
Many pilots knew by the age of five that they were going to be
pilots.

ISTPs tend to take up activities that allow them to use tools;
driving, steering, operating.  And if given a tool, whether scalpel
or earth mover, is operated with a precision that defies belief,
that operator is likely an ISTP.  Others use tools, of course, but
not with the virtuosity of the ISTP.

Indeed, we must call ISTP's the tool artisans, for they above all
others command the tool and bend it to their impulse.  But again,
ISTPs - personified in Michaelangelo and Leonardo - work (or
better, play) with their tools on personal impulse and not on
schedule.  If an externally imposed schedule coincides with
impulse, fine; if not, so much the worse for the schedule.

One tool especially attractive to the ISTP is the weapon.  Should
ISTPs turn against society (for whatever reason), they wield their
weapons with lethal genius to support their rejection.  The hit man
of today, the gunslinger of the American West, and the duelist of
18th Century Europe, may be seen as virtuosos of precision
homicide.

Hit man, gunslinger, and duelist alike took pride in their prowess.
Fortunately, they face their own kind in battle, the good warriors
of the land: soldier, marshal, police, intelligence agent.  This is
not to say that all warriors, good or bad, are ISTPs, or that ISTPs
are all weapons experts; rather that the weapon virtuoso is more
frequently ISTP than not.

ISTPs also play on impulse, taking off at any time just because
they "feel like it."  (We are advised not to try to stop the ISTP
who "feels like" doing something.)  The neurosurgeon does crop
dusting on the side and rides a motorcycle to the airport, and the
financier goes on a hunting trip in the middle of an audit (i.e.,
SJ scrutiny).  There can be no end to the ways ISTPs seek thrills
in play.

Although they may have the appearance of loners in their work, they
nonetheless hang around their own kind in play.  The climbers,
racers, flyers, hunters, and in general, movers flock together. The
companionship is mediated through the tool, and conversation is
sparse and terse.

Like the ISFPs, ISTPs communicate through action, and show little
interest in developing verbal skills.  Indeed, this lack of
interest in communication may be mistaken for what well meaning but
misguided medics and educators call "learning disability" or
"dyslexia," both preposterous notions when meant as explanations.
Let ISFPs get near a tool of any complexity and power and see how
fast they pass up everybody in 'learning' to use it and how precise
their 'lexicon' in talking of its features.

Despite their egalitarianism, insubordination, and love of freedom,
they can be leaders, even great ones.  But they must be "up front,"
sword in hand, leading the charge.  That is to say, ISTPs can be
very successful as battle leaders, for instance, no matter how
large or small the force under their command.  Their supreme
realism, timing, and sense of expediency allows them to seize the
moment and fully exploit whatever resources can be gotten (theirs
or others) and capitalize on deficits and mistakes of their
opponent.

Theirs is an expediency or exploitative leadership, based on a
special kind of intelligence which may be called artistic
concreteness.  Yes, for the ISTP battle leader, combat is an art,
an intellectual game, not in the sense of strategy (that is for
NTs), but rather using whatever is at hand to defeat the other with
the least injury.

Battle leaders are duellists.  Patton was such a leader, and we
must credit Marshall (an NTJ strategist) for seeing beneath that
flamboyant, impulsive, insubordinate, and reckless exterior a
peerless warrior.  The same credit goes to Grant (another NTJ) for
selecting Sheridan (STP), and to Hitler (ENFJ) for selecting Rommel
(ISTP).  Patton, Sheridan, and Rommel were cut from the same cloth
and showed the same artistic espionage and rapier-like tactics.

Glory is a pre-20th Century concept better understood by the ISTP
than by others.  Or at least the ISTP is more interested in it than
most others.  In battle there is glory, for it is in battle that
one can exercise one's lethal skills with positive sanction.

The Seven Samurai were glorified and so have been duellists down
through the ages.  Foss, Boyington, Fonck, and von Richtoffen, all
virtuosos of the winged machine gun, are still glorified heroes.
But there are hundreds of warriors just like them in nature.  One
can test one's mettle in lethal duel, there's glory in it, as the
film The Great Waldo Pepper showed most poetically.

The education and intelligence of the ISTP is worth special
comment.  Possessed of artisan intelligence, ISTP is not in the
least interested in the clerical, interpretive, and "science"
curricula that abound in the 20th Century school.  The other SPs,
equally bored by the school, will at least act as if they're trying
to learn, but not ISTP.  ISTP will stare coldly into the eyes of
the teacher and not even say no.  No amount of cajoling, bribing,
rewarding, punishing, or threat will get them to do their school
work.

School work, quite apart from being irrelevant to the talents of
SPs, is, after all, mere preparation for something the ISTPs figure
they're never going to do anyway.  SPs do not wish to prepare - for
anything - and ISTPs are careful to make this clear to their
would-be instructors.

What is there to 'do', 'now', that is 'worthwhile'?  ISTP will not
sit still (literally) for the trivial fare dished out
(sanctimoniously, in the eyes of the ISTP).  Most seem to agree
that ISTPs "should" do their school work.  But why? The arguments
are piddling and incoherent, warranting the scorn they get from the
unshakable ISTP.

ISTPs are not "minimally brain damaged," or "hyperactive," or
"dyslexic"; they are active, and they are stubbornly insistent upon
getting to do, in school, some things that allow them to test their
intelligence and their mettle.  Name-calling and pill-pushing won't
change them, other than destroying their self confidence and
perhaps creating a stimulant addict now and then.  Give them a
tool-centered curriculum and watch their speed.

Behaviorally the ISTP is more like the ESTP than any other type,
and the older they get, the greater the resemblance.  When young,
ISTPs may look very much like ISFPs, but as their confidence and
pride increase this resemblance recedes.  Jungians think ISTPs are
just like INTPs with only minor differences, but this is based on
the definition of ISTPs as "introverted thinking types."

INTPs are logicians, philologists, and architects in the way they
think, but ISTPs are completely disinterested in these pursuits.
Even a cursory observation of a few clear-cut ISTPs will show how
striking the contrast, and how trivial the resemblance.

Still, the most important thing about the ISTPs is their
commonality with other SPs.  We might think that there would be
some resemblance to the ISTJ, having as they do, "IST" in common.
but no, their behavior is antithetical in almost every dimension of
comparison.  One is pessimistic while the other optimistic; one is
parental, the other, fraternal; one saves, the other spends; one
believes in rules, the other is instinctual insubordinate and
recalcitrant to rules; and so on.

ISTPs have infinitely more in common with the very different ESFP
than they do with any NT or SJ; besides the above, their mood is
one of good cheer, they are loyal to their equals, they want no
obligations, duties, or confining promises, are uncomplicated in
their desires, and are trusting, receptive, and generous.
