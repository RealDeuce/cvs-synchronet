The Judgement type tends toward planning, goal setting, deciding, and
getting-things-done. Once the J makes a decision he tends to be fixed and
inflexible. The J finds himself always waiting for others - who are always
late; thinks that if everyone would do what they are supposed to, the world
would be a better place, has a personal schedule for the day, and gets 
frustrated when the schedule is interrupted, doesn't like surprises, keeps
lists, thrives on order, likes to finish-the-job.
J creates an environment that is structured, scheduled, ordered, planned,
and controlled; is decisive, deliberate.
J's plan their work and work their plan.
The population is equally divided between Js and Ps.
