INTJs in short:

Usually have original minds and great drive for their own ideas and
purposes.  In fields that appeal to them, they have a fine power to
organize a job and carry it through with or without help.
Skeptical, critical, independent, determined, often stubborn.  Must
learn to yield less important points in order to win the most
important.

About 1% of the population.

Details about INTJs:

INTJs are the most self-confident of all the types, having
"self-power" awareness.  Found in about 1 percent of the general
population, the INTJs live in an introspective reality,  focusing
on possibilities, using thinking in the form of empirical logic,
and preferring that events and people serve some positive use.
Decisions come naturally to the INTJs; once a decision is made,
INTJs are at rest.  INTJs look to the future rather than the past,
and a word which captures the essence of INTJs is 'builder' - a
builder of systems and the applier of theoretical models.

To INTJs, authority based on position, rank, title, or publication
has absolutely no force.  This type is not likely to succumb to the
magic of slogans, watchwords, or shibboleths.  If an idea or
position makes sense to an INTJ, it will be adopted; if it doesn't,
it won't, regardless of who took the position or generated the
idea.  As with the INTP, authority per se does not impress the
INTJ.

INTJs do, however, tend to conform to rules if they are useful, not
because they believe in them, or because they make sense, but
because of their unique view of reality.  They are the supreme
pragmatists, who see reality as something which is quite arbitrary
and made up.  Thus it can be used as a tool - or ignored.

Reality is quite malleable and can be changed, conquered, or
brought to a heel.  Reality is a crucible for the refining of
ideas, and in this sense, INTJs are the most theoretical of all the
types. An INTJ sees reality as the pawn of ideas: No idea is too
farfetched to be entertained.  INTJs are natural brainstormers,
always open to new concepts, and, in fact, aggressively seeking
them.

INTJs manipulate the world of theory as if on a gigantic chess
board, always seeking strategies and tactics that have high payoff.
In their penchant for logic, the INTJs resemble the INTPs.  The
logic of an INTJ, however, is not confined to the expressibly
logical.  Unlike INTPs, INTJs need only to have a vague, intuitive
impression of the unexpressed logic of a system to continue surely
on their way.  Things need only 'seem' logical; this is entirely
sufficient.

Moreover, they always have a keen eye for the consequences of the
application of new ideas or positions.  They can be quite ruthless
in the implementation of systems, seldom counting personal cost in
terms of time and energy.  Theories which cannot be made to work
are quickly discarded by the INTJs.

To understand INTJs, their way of dealing with reality rather than
their way of dealing with ideas should be observed closely.  Their
conscious thought is extroverted and empirical.  Hence, they are
better at generalizing, classifying, summarizing, adducing
evidence, proving and demonstrating than are the INTPs.

The INTJs are somewhat less at home with pure reason, that is,
systemic logic, where principles are explicit.  In this respect
they resemble the ENTJs.  The INTJs, rather than using deductive
logic, use their intuition to grasp coherence.

INTJs have a drive to completion, always with an eye to long-term
consequences.  Ideas seem to carry their own force for INTJs,
although they subject every idea to the test of usefulness.

Difficulties are highly stimulating to INTJs, who love responding
to a challenge that requires creativity.  Those personality traits
lead INTJs to occupations where theoretical models can be
translated into actuality.  They build data and human systems
wherever they work if given even a slight opportunity.  They can be
outstanding in scientific research and also outstanding as
executives who generate a plethora of implementations of ideas.

Teamed with an INTP who is the architect of systems, the INTJ
provides a dimension to an organization which insures that the work
of the INTP does not gather dust on library shelves.

INTJs can be very single-minded at times; this can be either a
weakness or a strength in their careers, for they can ignore the
points of view and wishes of others.  INTJs usually rise to
positions of responsibility, for they work long and hard and steady
in their pursuit of goals, sparing neither time nor effort on their
part or that of their colleagues and employees.

INTJs live to see systems translated into substance; an INTP, by
way of contrast, is content to design the system.  In both, these
types, however, coherence is the master.  Both internal and
external consistency are important, and if an INTJ finds that he or
she is in a working situation where overlapping functions,
duplication of effort, inefficient paper flow, and waste of human
and material resources abound, the INTJ cannot rest until an effort
is made to correct the situation.  Cost-effectiveness is a concept
which has a strong imperative for INTJs, who frequently select
occupations in engineering, particularly human engineering.

They also can be found in the physical sciences, in roles which
require development, such as curriculum building, and, in general,
any job which requires the creation and application of technology
to complex areas.

Fellow workers of INTJs often feel as if the INTJ can see right
through them, and often believe that the INTJ finds them wanting.
This tendency of people to feel transparent in the presence of the
INTJ often results in relationships which have psychological
distance.  Thus colleagues find the INTJ apparently unemotional
and, at times, cold and dispassionate.  Because of their tendency
to drive others as hard as themselves, INTJs often seem demanding
and difficult to satisfy.

INTJs are high achievers in school and on the job.  On the job,
they take the goals of the institution seriously and continually
strive to respond to these goals.  They make dedicated, loyal
employees whose loyalties are directed toward the system, rather
than toward individuals within the system.  So as the people of an
institution come and go, the INTJs have little difficulty - unlike
the NFs, who have their loyalties involved more with persons than
offices.

INTJs ordinarily tend to verbalize the positive and eschew comments
of a negative nature; they are more interested in moving an
institution forward than commiserating about mistakes of the past.

As mates, INTJs want harmony and order in the home and in
relationships.  They are the most independent of all the types.
They will trust their intuitions about others when making choices
of friends and mates, even in the face of contradictory evidence
and pressures applied by others.

The emotions of an INTJ are hard to read, and neither male nor
female INTJ is apt to express emotional reactions.  At times, both
will seem cold, reserved, and unresponsive, while in fact INTJs are
almost hypersensitive to signals of rejection from those for whom
they care.

In social situations, INTJs may also be unresponsive and may
neglect to observe small rituals designed to put others at their
ease.  For example, INTJs may communicate that time is wasted if
used for idle dialogue, and thus people receive a sense of hurry
from an INTJ which is not always intended.  In their interpersonal
relationships, INTJs are usually better in a working situation than
in recreational situations.  They do not enjoy physical contact
except with a chosen few.

As parents, INTJs are dedicated and single-minded in their
devotion: Their children are a major focus in life.  They are
supportive of their children and tend to allow them to develop in
directions of their own choosing.  INTJs usually are firm and
consistent in their discipline and rarely care to repeat directions
given to children - or others.

Being the most independent of all the types, they have a strong
need for autonomy; indifference or criticism from people in general
does not particularly bother INTJs, if they believe that they are
right.  They also have a strong need for privacy.

The most important preference of an INTJ is 'intuition', but this
is seldom seen.  Rather, the function of 'thinking' is used to deal
with the world and with people.  INTJs are vulnerable in the
emotional area and may make serious mistakes here.
