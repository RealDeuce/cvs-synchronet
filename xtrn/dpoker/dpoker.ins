                             bhFor Synchronet

    hcTo start off, let me give you a quick explanation of what Domain
Poker is.  Domain Poker is a Multi Player on-line poker game, designed
especially for Synchronet BBS systems.  It exactly resembles an actual game
of 5 card draw poker.  Since I don't plan to explain how to play poker in
these instructions (these are only intended to help you through the onliner)
if you don't know how to play poker select the 'How to play poker' option
from the menu or check your nearest encyclopedia (or just go ahead and play
- who knows, you may get the hang of it).

    Now then, on to the game.  To play the game, you will need to hit J) from
the game main menu.  This will take you into the game (which will currently
play up to 6 players per table), if there is a game in progress, you will
receive a message telling that you must wait or you can hit ^A to abort this
waiting process.

Note: Upon hitting 'J' you will be shown a list of tables with some statistics
      next to them.  The first few statistics are self explanitory.  If the
      table listed has b[rPW Lockb]c next to it, it means that table is
      currently password protected and you must know the password to play on
      it.  If the table has b[rNo Comp Playerb]c next to it, it means that
      there is no computer player available at that table (no single player
      game allowed there).

    While playing the game, you can look at the prompt to see what mode the
game is currently in.  The first section of the prompt will show the words
[Open], [Betting], or [Discard].  You will also receive periodic messages
telling you who is doing what.  You may also hit 'L' to list the users, next
to their name, you will see what that person is doing.  When the game stage
is [Open], this is the point where other people may join the game.

    As the game goes on, the deck is passed on to the next person (just like
in real poker) and, just like in real poker, you can raise the bet, call or
fold.  When a new person enters the game, the deck is passed to the newcomer
(once again, just like in real poker).

    On these multi-player games, depending upon the configuration decided upon
by your SysOp, a percentage of the total pot may go to the house (customary)
for table usage (similar to Vegas).

    The single player game (if allowed by the SysOp) is the same as the multi-
player game, except that rather than playing another user, you will play a
simulated player.  Note that you may not be able to password protect a game vs.
the computer, and the computer player may not be available on all tables (if
he is available at all) depending upon the configuration decided upon by your
SysOp.

    As always - hyENJOY!
