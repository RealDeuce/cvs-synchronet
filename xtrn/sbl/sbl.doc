Synchronet BBS List v3.20 (native 32-bit for Win32 and Unix)
=========================

Create the directory: SBL off of your Synchronet XTRN directory.
(Example: C:\SBBS\XTRN\SBL) 

Make sure SBL.CFG are is this directory.

Use an ASCII editor to edit the Synchronet BBS List config file (SBL.CFG) to 
your liking.

Under SCFG->External Programs->Online Programs->Main, hit INS (if it doesn't
already exist) and add Synchronet BBS List with the following configuration:

Name                       Synchronet BBS List
Internal Code              SBL
Start-up Directory         ..\xtrn\sbl
Command Line               sbl%.
Clean-up Command Line
Execution Cost             None
Access Requirements
Execution Requirements
Multiple Concurrent Users  Yes
Intercept Standard I/O     No
Native (32-bit) Executable Yes
Use Shell to Execute       No
Modify User Data           No
Execute on Event           No
BBS Drop File Type         Synchronet      XTRN.DAT
Place Drop File In         Node Directory

SBL Utilities
=============

SBLPACK         Remove deleted entries to save disk space and speed up listings

Networking the Synchronet BBS List
==================================

If you wish to link your SBL database with other Synchronet BBSes, you must
carry the Synchronet Data echo via DOVE-Net, FidoNet, or RIME and add
the following two events in SCFG->External Programs->Timed Events:

Internal Code                   SMB2SBL
Start-up Directory              ..\xtrn\sbl
Command Line                    smb2sbl%. %jsubs\syncdata sbl.dab
Execution Node                  1
Execution Days of Month         Any
Execution Days of Week          All
Execution Time                  00:00
Requires Exclusive Execution    No
Force Users Off-line For Event  No
Native (32-bit) Executable      Yes
Use Shell to Execute            No
Background Execution            No

Internal Code                   SBL2SMB
Start-up Directory              ..\xtrn\sbl
Command Line                    sbl2smb%. sbl.dab %jsubs\syncdata
Execution Node                  11
Execution Days of Month         Any
Execution Days of Week          All
Execution Time                  00:00
Requires Exclusive Execution    No
Force Users Off-line For Event  No
Native (32-bit) Executable      Yes
Use Shell to Execute            No
Background Execution            No

Change "SYNCDATA" to the internal code of the Synchronet Data sub-board on
your BBS. We used SYNCDATA, since that is the example given in the Synchronet
manual for the DOVE-Net Synchronet Data sub-board internal code. It is okay
if you used a completely different internal code, as long as you specify that
code instead of "SYNCDATA" on the above command lines.

Make note that all networked SBL entries will be deleted from Vertrauen
(Home of the Synchronet BBS List) after 90 days unless the entry is
retransmitted in the message base or updated manually on Vertrauen in that
time. To cause a retransmission from your BBS, you must (U)pdate the entry
using SBL and then SBL2SMB will re-export it automatically next time it is run
(via Timed Event). (V)erified entries are not re-exported by SBL2SMB, only new
and updated entries. You can also create a BBS entry message by hand (not
using SBL). Download SBBSLIST.ZIP from Vertrauen for more details.

Source Code
===========

If you are a C programmer, you may find the included source code interesting
and/or useful as an example for writing your own XSDK and/or SMB utilities.

Makefile is for use with Borland C++ or C++Builder and the Synchronet XSDK
to create SBL.EXE. GNUmakefile is for use with the GNU C Compiler.
And sbl.dsp is for use with Microsoft Visual C++ v6.0.
