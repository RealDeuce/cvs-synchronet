Synchronet BBS List Sysop Information
=====================================

This list is created and distributed every Monday. It is exported from the
online BBS List database on Vertrauen and distributed via the SYNCMAIN FidoNet
filebone file echo as SBBSLIST.ZIP.

If you are a sysop of a Synchronet BBS and would like to have your BBS included
in future versions of this list, do any one of the following:

	o  Call Vertrauen at 714-529-9525 and use the Synchronet BBS List
	   (external program) to add your system information.

	o  See \SBBS\XTRN\SBL\SBL.DOC for instructions on networking your SBL
	   database (v1.32+) with Vertrauen through DOVE-Net or  FidoNet.

	o  Post a message on the Synchronet Data echo (via DOVE-Net or the
	   SYNCDATA echo on FidoNet backbone) in the following format:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The message must be posted to "SBL". If updating an existing entry, the message
must be posted by the person who created the original entry. The title
(subject) must be your BBS name. If changing the BBS name, the title must be
the original name, and "NAME:" must be specified in the body text.

All entry fields are optional. Only one field can be specified per line. The
amount of whitespace between the colon and the data is irrelevant. All lines
that do not begin with a valid field name and colon (like these) are ignored.
Field names are not case sensitive (e.g. NAME: and Name: are equivalent).
The order of the entry fields in the body text is not significant.

Entries must be updated at least once every 90 days or they are automatically
deleted. If you wish to delete your entry, send a message to SBL with the BBS
name in the title and include a blank "Name:" field.

If you want to just update an entry (to keep it from being auto-deleted), you
do not have to specify any fields in the body text. But, it is suggested that
you re-post all of your fields for all updates so that any new systems that are
"watching" this sub-board can add your complete entry to their list.

Up to 20 phone numbers can be specified. The number is limited to 12
characters (so please use AAA-PPP-SSSS format), location is limited to 30
characters, and modem description is limited to 15 characters. Do NOT put
38400 or 57600 for maximum connect rate (MaxRate), as such standards do not
yet exist.

For all numeric files (noted as: "numbers only"), do not use commas, symbols,
or letters. A MaxRate of 14,400bps must be specified as "14400".
