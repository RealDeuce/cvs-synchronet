DISCLAIMER:     This shouldn't do anything besides take up very little space
                on the old hard drive and give you a kickass LORDTXT.DAT and
                LENEMY.DAT.  If it fucks up your computer in ANY way, which
                it shouldn't, don't come crying to me like a damn pussy.

DIRECTIONS:     This isn't childproof, any fucking idiot can run it.  Put
                it in your LORD directory and unzip the fucker.  Backup your
                LORDTXT.DAT and LENEMY.DAT files in case you hate this.

DESCRIPTION:    This file is here for 1 reason and 1 reason only.  To combine
                2 of the kick-assin'est games in the history of PC's, Legend
                Of the Red Dragon by Seth Able Robinson and DOOM by ID
                Software.  Too bad you can't see the fuckin' blood here!
                The LORDTXT.DAT part of the file is set in Hell because,
                well, DOOM is set in hell for the most part.  It also
                contains demons like Tabots, Barbatos, Lucifuge Rofocale, and
                the great Satan Mekatrig.  The LENEMY.DAT part of the file
                contains the DOOM monsters.  There aren't many different
                monsters because of the lack of monsters in DOOM.  Every
                level will have the Former Humans, although they get tougher
                with each level, and there are about 9 or 10 different kinds
                of Former Humans per level.  The other monsters will appear
                in one level a piece.  They're the supreme monsters of the
                level.  Former Human Sergeants, Imps, Demons, Specters, Lost
                Souls, Cacodemons, Barons of Hell, The Spider Mastermind,
                Mancubus, Revenant, Pain Elemental, Former Human Commandos,
                Arachnotrons, Hell Knights, Arch-Viles, and, of course,
                CYBERDEMONS are included.  Hell even the Radiactive Ooze
                makes an appearance.  Just play the damn game.
