ÄÄÄÄÄÄ  Lord Text - Fall Version ÄÄÄÄÄÄ

        I was bored of seen the same old lord and I couldn't find too many
Lord Textfiles of interest.  Except for Winter LORD,  i found it to be pretty
good.  So I've made it my goal to make a lord text version for each season.
Look for them...

Installation

        Unzip the Zip into your LORD directory and type FallINST.  This
file will install the new texts and backup the old ones for an uninstall,
also included in the program. 

ENJOY!
