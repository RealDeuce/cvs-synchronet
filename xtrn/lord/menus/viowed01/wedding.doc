                          *** 1. About Violet ***

   Have you ever started playing LORD (Legend Of the Red Dragon), either
   locally or on a BBS and think, besides getting killed by John Doe today
   its still the same thing! You use up your forest fights, kill a few
   people, (if available)go to Other places and try to get a little further.
     I am not putting LORD down or anything, but most boards have the default
   of 10 heroic deeds set up to finish the game! If you noticed, it could
   take a couple of months just to do 1 heroic deed! So, to actually finish
   the game, it could take well over a year and 1/2! I dont know if its just
   me, but I like to finish games within 2 months!
   Most people like to have friends in the realm so they cant kill a lot
   of people! Well, I am one of those people that trys to kill that guy that
   is 3 levels higher than me! Now, thats when I started realizing that if
   I saved up my money and killed that guy, I would get a LOT of experience!
     Thats the MAIN reason I decided to write this program! First, it gives
   LORD a totally new look, the menus are more colorful and I think they
   look a lot more attractive! The second reason, the storyline of this game
   puts all the players into a MYSTERY situation. It's there job to figure
   out who done it or will do it....although when you regester then you will
   receive part 2......the ending <G>
   This makes the game more interesting.





-=-=Manual Installation=-=-

Go to your LORD directory and rename the following files...

lordtxt.dat  to  lordtxt.old

Now,   rename wedding.dat  to  lordtxt.dat

Ok, now move both of them files to your LORD directory and its all
set up!







--= Why are there no RIP screens with WarLord? =--

** If this program gets some registered users and some attention **
**      I will create the new RIP screens everyone wants!        **



--= I thought this program was FREEWARE, why would I register it? =--

** Yes, this program is FREEWARE, you dont have to send me a cent **
** to use it! But I took a lot of my time to write this program   **
** so you and your callers could enjoy it! If everyone would send **
** me some spare change, it would make me want to add more and    **
** more to my program, and possibly write more programs.          **
** Like I said earlier, I WILL add more if a few people register! **
** Also you get the ending of the 2 part series..<G> Gotta give you
   a reason to register..<G>


--= What do I get if I register? =--

** Well, the main thing you get is knowing that you helped another **
** person out by making his hard spent time worth something!       **
** But, thats probably not enough, so you also get the concluding  **
** version, by E-Mail, and you will get added to my mailing list  **
** for all new programs I write in the future. (Shareware, or      **
** FREEWARE only! I cant give you ALL my registered programs!)     **


--= Where do I send my registration money? =--

** See chapter 6 for more information on registering **
