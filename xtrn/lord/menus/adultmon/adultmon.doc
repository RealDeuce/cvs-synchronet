        edited to contain Adult Monsters for the Legend of the Red Dragon
        Door game. This document was written to give just a few 
        instructions that are helpful to those few who have never worked
        with the Lenemy.Dat files before.

  The most important thing to keep in mind is to backup your original 
  Lenemy.Dat file in your LORD directory. This will pretty much
  guarantee that the game will not crash permanently if something goes
  wrong with the new Lenemy.Dat file. Once you have done this, simply copy
  the new Lenemy.Dat file over your old one. It's as easy as that. After 
  that, each time you decide to trade off with another file again, just 
  follow the same process as said above.  ENJOY!!! -- Dawn Evans
