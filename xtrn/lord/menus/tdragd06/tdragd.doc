                          Question and Answer
                        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
     
     Q: What is this thing anyways?
     ------------------------------
     A: It is simply a modification of the text for LORD with all new         
        colors, and new monsters.

     Q: What is it about?
     --------------------
     A: It is based on the aftermath of a huge attack by the Red Dragon.
        Everything is in ruins.  However, not all new monsters are
        based on the attack by the dragon, but include humorous characters
        such as Bill Clinton or Lorena Bobbitt. It also includes a few
        monsters from another program of the same type called Winter
        LORD.

                               Installation
                         -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
                         
      1.) Go to your Lord Directory and copy Lordtxt.dat and lenemy.dat to 
         another directory, so if you dislike the program, you can just 
         delete the included lordtxt.dat and lenemy.dat and copy the 
         old lordtxt.dat and lenemy.dat back to your lord directory.

      2.) Copy the two dat files included in this zip file to your LORD
          directory.
           
      3.) Now run LORD... Enjoy.
