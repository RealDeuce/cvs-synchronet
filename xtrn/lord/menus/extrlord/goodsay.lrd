"Gimme my head BACK, `g!" `e screams.
"I wasn't ready!," `e screams.
"How dare you presume to strike ME, `g,"`n  `e screams.
"This means WAR!," `e shouts savagely.
"Ack!  What a jealous person you've become, `g!,`n  `e cries.
"You have NO right to that, `g!," `e whines.
"And don't you EVER come 'round here again!," `g warns.
"Mommy wow, look at me now!" `g happily sings.
"YESSS!  My luck has finally changed!," `g yells.
"The Gods have deserted me!!," `e insists.
"Yeow!  My sword is hot today!," `g states.
"Your nothing but an overgrown catfish, `g," admonishes`n  `e.
"The only reason you won was because I wasn't feeling well!," whines `n  `e.
"Well looks like you got ahead of yourself today!" taunts `g.
"GREAT BALLS OF FIRE, I'M GOOD!," cries `g in delight.
"You will have no children!," curses `e with relish.
"Oh don't get a big head, `g!  You suck!," taunts `e.
"I guess I should have ducked on that last swing!" implies `e.
"Oh man..I should've stayed in bed today...," moans `e.
"I don't usually swear...but...TORAKS TOOTH!," swears `e.
"If I ever see you in this town again, I'll whup ya again!,"`n  laughs `g.
"I hope the ivy grows around your rotting body, `e,"`n  laughs `g.
"Holy Moly!  You're such an ass!," shrieks `e.
"Next time `e, try a thing called putting up a fight, eh,"`n  `g says seriously.
"Defeat me, will ya?  I have friends in this world!," squeals `e.
"If you were a fruit, you would be a crab-apple!, `g!,"`n  `e mutters.
"At least I have honor, something you cannot say, `g,"`n  `e rebukes.
"I wish I'd never been born!," rants `e.
`g laughs.
`g kicks `e one more time for good measure.
`e sobs uncontrollably.
`e cries bitterly.  "I thought you were my friend!"
`e cries bitterly.  "I don't know how, but you cheated!"
"You're a loser.  You will always be a loser," `g informs `e.
"Oh fine...Just destroy my life please!," `e says tearfully.
"Oh my God!  I'm covered in blood!," gasps `e.
"My goodness.  I do believe I'm dead." `e realizes.
`g does a little dance over `e's grave.
`e's scream as he falls is heard all over the realm.
`g sticks `e's head on a stick for all to see.
`e's ashen white face is mud splattered.
"Beware, DRAGON!  For you are next," `g promises.
