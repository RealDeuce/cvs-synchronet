                -= LEGEND1.ZIP - FROM LEGENDARY SOFTWARE =-

        First, let me tell you up front thanks for using this program on 
your game!  LEGEND1.ZIP will change the text and menu's your of Legend of 
Red Dragon game into a new and exciting world.  Installing simply replaces 
your LORDTXT.DAT file into the one that you have just received. 

             Files you should have received in this .zip file:

                            LEGEND1.DOC
                            LORDTXT!.DAT
                            INSTALL.BAT
                            UNDO.BAT

****** DISCLAIMER ******

We, Chris Gustafson and Ryan Chmiel, the writers of this program, will NOT
be responsible for any damage that this program does to your LORD game or
your system in any which way.  This is provided "AS IS", and if you read
this document and learn how to install and uninstall LEGEND1.ZIP, you should
not have ANY problems at all.

****** INSTALLATION *******

Installation of this is very easy (Too easy in fact!  :-) )

All you have to do is unzip this file in the your LORD directory, and then, 
From the dos prompt, just type the following while you are in LORD's DIR:

INSTALL.BAT

That's it!  Nothing else.  After this, log on to LORD to experience your 
new LORD game.  But if you are experiencing more anger than intended, you 
can go back to your normal one by typing:

UNDO.BAT

at the dos prompt.  This will take all files included in this .zip and 
delete them, and return your old LORDTXT.DAT file to what it was.

****** THANKS! *******

Thanks goes out to all who use this product, but none of this would happen
