Story:

=============================================================================
 
The village has just gone through it's rainy season, but this year was
extraordinary... There was a massive flood that rampaged through the 
village. Luckily none of the buildings were hurt nor any villagers.

Rumor has it that the rain has flooded out an abandoned cave that the
Red Dragon had taken refuge in. With the extra rain it has forced 
the Dragon out. Now, this cave is very close to the town, and you
must kill the dragon before it can attack the village.
 
The village is depending on you and your fellow comrades to defeat the
Red Dragon. Don't let the villagers down.

                          *** 1. About Wetlord ***

   Have you ever started playing LORD (Legend Of the Red Dragon), either
   locally or on a BBS and think, besides getting killed by John Doe today
   its still the same thing! You use up your forest fights, kill a few
   people, (if available) go to Other places and try to get a little further.
     I am not putting LORD down or anything, but most boards have the default
   of 10 heroic deeds set up to finish the game! If you noticed, it could
   take a couple of months just to do 1 heroic deed! So, to actually finish
   the game, it could take well over a year and 1/2! I dont know if its just
   me, but I like to finish games within 2 months!
   Most people like to have friends in the realm so they cant kill a lot
   of people! Well, I am one of those people that trys to kill that guy that
   is 3 levels higher than me! Now, thats when I started realizing that if
   I saved up my money and killed that guy, I would get a LOT of experience!
     Thats the MAIN reason I decided to write this program! First, it gives
   LORD a totally new look, the menus are more colorful and I think they
   look a lot more attractive! The second reason, the storyline of this game
   puts all the players in a FLOOD.  This will change only little things
   This will not touch the LORD.EXE, besides its illegal for me to do that.. 




                      *** 2. Installation Instructions ***

   Installing Wetlord should be a simple process since all it does is
   it renames your current lenemy.dat and lordtxt.dat files to
   lenemy.old and lordtxt.old.


-=-=Batch Installation=-=-

To use the batch files for installation simply extract the
contents of the zip file to any directory (you probably already
did that!) Run the file INSTALL.BAT with a parameter of where
your LORD is installed.

*Example*
INSTALL.BAT C:\LORD

Its that easy! To Uninstall simply move to your LORD directory
at the DOS prompt and type UNINSTAL.BAT (or UNINSTAL).
But please note, if you haven't already installed Wetlord before
running this file, you will lose a few files LORD needs to run!


** If for some reason you did run the Uninstall program first, here
** is how you fix it...

** You must have your original Lord zip file to fix this problem!
** Inside of the lord.zip file you will find the two files that you
** are missing. Look for lenemy.dat and lordtxt.dat. Ok, extract or
** move them to your lord directory and its all fixed up!
** Of course, who is dumb enough to run the uninstall program first? =)


-=-=Manual Installation=-=-

If for some reason you need to do a manual installation here is how...
Go to your LORD directory and rename the following files...

lenemy.dat  to  lenemy.old
lordtxt.dat  to  lordtxt.old

Now,   rename wenemy.dat  to  lenemy.dat
       rename wartext.dat  to  lordtxt.dat

Ok, now move both of them files to your LORD directory and its all
set up!





                             *** 3. Updates ***

If you would like to recieve updates of this program, see 6. Registering 
Wetlord later in this file...
I plan to update all monsters, screens, and so on in the near future...
The screens are all finished now, but I have more ideas to add to them!
There are no monsters complete so far, I can't figure out how to put them
in the LENEMY.DAT file, so I hope to get some monsters in here also...





                            *** 4. Questions ***



--= I thought this program was FREEWARE, why would I register it? =--

** Yes, this program is FREEWARE, you dont have to send me a cent **
** to use it! But I took a lot of my time to write this program   **
** so you and your callers could enjoy it! If everyone would send **
** me some spare change, it would make me want to add more and    **
** more to my program, and possibly write more programs.          **
** Like I said earlier, I WILL add more if a few people register! **



--= What do I get if I register? =--

** Well, the main thing you get is knowing that you helped another **
** person out by making his hard spent time worth something!       **
** But, thats probably not enough, so you also get all newer       **
** versions, by E-Mail, and you will get added to my mailing list  **
** for all new programs I write in the future. (Shareware, or      **
** FREEWARE only! I cant give you ALL my registered programs!)     **


--= Where do I send my registration money? =--

** See chapter 6 for more information on registering **

                      *** 1. Registering Wetlord ***

Ok, you are probably thinking "I thought this was a FREEWARE program"!!!
Well, it is, you dont have to send me 1 cent!
But I took a lot of my time to write this program so you and your callers
could enjoy it! If everyone would send me some spare change, it would make
me want to add more and more to my program, and possible write more programs.
Like I said earlier, I WILL add more if a few people register!
Another benefit of registering is you will get ALL newer updated versions!
You will get the newest version before it is available for download
on BBS's. You will also get the satisfaction of knowing that I
will take all donations and put them to my future of programming! I am saving
up for C++ or Turbo Pascal as we speak. I then realized that my life was meant
for programming and making people happy with my programs, so I decided to
start with this little program! Its not a programmed program, but it did take
me a long time to create! Anyway, sorry about blabbing on about my life...
Here is my address to send any donations to. If you dont want to send
anything, I understand! You are too greedy to send that $3 or $4 dollars
from your pocket! Just kidding... Send any ammount to....
Once again, thanx for BETA testing my program for me!   - Jason Peterson
