         The Vampires and the Undead is a ansi graphic and monster add-on
         for L.O.R.D. Its theme is obviously Vampires and Undead creatures.
         However, it does NOT promote Satan or Satanism in anyway.  It 
         features dark colors, creating a "spooky" feeling for the players.
         It also has the artwork of a grave for the Forest Menu (BTW, with
         LORDTXT.DAT it took over 3 hours just to make the grave!) It also has
         over 120 new undead and vampire monsters! Challenge your users to 
         defeat the Pain Elemental and The Great Vampire!
