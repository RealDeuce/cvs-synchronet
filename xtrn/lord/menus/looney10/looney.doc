    Use these files at your own risk (this means backup your lordtxt.dat 
  and your lenemy.dat files first <GRIN>).  The only guarantee that exsists
  with these files is that they will occupy some small segment of your disk 
  drive.  The files have been scanned for viruses and none were found.  It
  works great on my bbs and is my most popular L.O.R.D. world.

>>>>Just what did you download???<<<<

    Well, this is a replacement Lordtxt.dat and Lenemy.dat for Legend of the 
  Red Dragon.  The subject manner is Saturday Morning cartoons.

>>>>How do I use it?<<<<

    First BACK UP YOUR EXISTING LORDTXT.DAT AND LENEMY.DAT (afterall you 
  may just hate these <GRIN>). Then copy these over your old ones then play 
  the game.  That's it!

>>>>Registration<<<<

  The required cost of registration is nothing.  This is donation-ware. I'm 
 not greedy, so whatever you think this is worth then send it (money is nice,
 Registration keys for IGMS (YAH, AS IF!), a porshe or whatever.<GRIN>) or
 drop me a line via US Mail or on my bbs.

   I would like to thank:

 Seth Able Robinson - For without you and your fabulous game I would have 
                      a quiet bbs.

 My Wife Deb        - For her understanding while I spent all my free time 
                      in front of my mistress, the computer.

                      Saturday mornings.
