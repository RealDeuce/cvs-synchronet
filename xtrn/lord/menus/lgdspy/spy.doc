[1.0]  What is it?

[ANS]  A LORD text replacement.  It was written for Spies-R-Us BBS.  Not on
request though, just because I got bored one night.

[1.1]  How do I install it?

[ANS]  Type "SPY INSTALL" without the quotation marks.  Actually, though,
the only command-line checking it does is to see if there's UN anywhere in
the command-line, and in that case it just uninstalls it.  The install
program is in no way perfect, because I coded it late at night. (I compiled
it at approximately 12:30am.)  If you do installs and uninstalls
repeatedly, it will eventually choke, giving File Not Found errors.
If you get kicks out of installing and uninstalling repeatedly, I'll make
you a special copy that won't choke, OK? ;^>

[1.2] How do I UNinstall it?

[ANS]  You can't!  I made the files read-only!  ;^>  Just kidding.  Just
type "SPY UN" (or "SPY UNINSTALL" if you prefer) and boom, it's gone.

[2.0] How do I register it?

[ANS]  Send me $1.25.  Here's my address:

        Michael Yount
        2922 Congaree Avenue, NW
        Aiken, South Carolina  29801-3102

Please note, there aren't any whiny "Your sysop is scum because he/she
didn't register this" messages.  But I'm trying to make a little money ...
I would like to get a phone line for a BBS.  Besides, for just $1.25 you'll
get all my other nifty stuff that I write, and you'll get REGISTERED
versions of my LORD stuff, be it an IGM or a text replacement like this.
