        First and foremost credit goes to Seth Able Robinson for writing 
        Legend Of the Red Dragon! A killer game destined to be #1 for many
        years to come!
        
        A special thanks to Joseph Masters for writing Monedit. Your
        freeware program made it a lot easier to edit the monsters. (Yes
        it is available for download here Joseph).

        Coming soon, custom menus for Lordnet.
