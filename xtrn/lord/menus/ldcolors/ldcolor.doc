Lord Menus Colorized - By Devon Brooks

What is it?
        It is certainly nothing big.  It is a LORDTXT.DAT file, which
        replaces your old one.  All this does is change the text which
        the users see on their end, and also changes the colors.

Of what use is this?
        I've seen other ones that do the exact same thing, just with
        different themes.  I thought I would do one up myself to see
        what it would be like, and this is what I got.  If you run alot
        of different, unique Lord flavours, you might like this.

Usage?
        I suggest making a backup of your original LORDTXT.DAT file
        before copying this one into your Lord dir.  The reason being
        if you don't like this one, you can always copy your old one
        back without any harm.  But if you don't back it up, then you're
        stuck.

        To use it, all you have to do is have this file in your Lord
        directory.  Lord reads it everytime the game runs, therefore no
        installation is required.  bahahaha :)

Thanks to?
        Seth Able Robinson, for providing a flexible original LORDTXT.DAT
        file which stupid people like me could learn off of, and modify
        to what you see now.  Oh yea and for writing the best door game
        ever :-)

        My Mom, who is sitting here watching me create this document,
        angrily waiting for her turn on the computer so she can finally
        play Mahjongg. (ugh)

        If you're still reading up until this point, thanks. I'm
        just a 15 year old teenager who knows very little about
        programming, but I'm learning. Thanks, hope you like it.
