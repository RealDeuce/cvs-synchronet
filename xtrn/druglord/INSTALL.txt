3. InterBBS global scores are disabled by default, but is simple to enable. Edit 'druglord.js' and set the 'USE_GLOBAL_SERVER' key in druglord_config to true:

	var druglord_config = {
		...
		USE_GLOBAL_SERVER: true,
		...
	}

   If you wish to use another InterBBS server or host your own high scores service please read the hosting section below.

Instructions
------------
Please see the README.txt document for in-game instructions.

------------------------
Hosting the JSON Service
------------------------
DrugLord can send and retrieve InterBBS data from the global server.  If you want to use another server, skip to step 4.

If you want to host your own JSON service, follow these steps:

1. Your BBS should be configured with the JSON service. In your ctrl/services.ini, ensure this is enabled:
	[JSON]
	Port=10088
	Options=STATIC | LOOP
	Command=json-service.js

2. Edit ctrl/json-service.ini, adding:
    [druglord]
	dir=../xtrn/druglord/
   Note that if you changed the installation path, this line must be similarly changed.

3. Restart the Synchronet Services service.

4. Edit 'server.ini' to set the host and port to the desired JSON service.

5. Edit 'druglord.js' and change the settings to:

	var druglord_config = {
		...
		USE_JSON: true,
		USE_GLOBAL_SERVER: false,
		...
	}
