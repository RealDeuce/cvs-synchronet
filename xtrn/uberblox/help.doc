Uber Blox is a puzzle strategy game similar to that of the  popular
web game "Super Collapse" by GameHouse. The object is to either clear
the screen entirely, or clear the number of blocks specified by the
"GOAL" for each particular level before running out of moves. 

Each level increases the "GOAL" to make it more difficult to clear 
the level and after a certain number of levels the game will add
another color to the block field.

***COMMANDS***

ARROW KEYS (up,down,left,right): 

	Navigate the field, highlighting the color of the block over 
	which you are current positioned.

ENTER KEY:

	When you press the ENTER key, it will light up a cluster of 
	connected blocks of the same color as the block you are 
	currently on. The point value of this cluster will be shown
	in the "SELECTION" field to the right of the block field. 

	If you wish to clear this cluster of blocks, Press the ENTER
	key again and the score shown in the "SELECTION" field will be
	added to your score. Otherwise, simply move your position 
	using the arrow keys and it will deselect the cluster.

QUITTING:
	
	If you press "Q" or the ESCAPE key, your current game will be
	ended and your score will be saved if it is higher than your
	current best score. Otherwise your score will be discarded
	until you beat your previous best score.

***RULES***

By default, the smallest grouping of blocks you can select is THREE. 
If you try to select a single block or TWO blocks grouped together
(depending on your SysOp's game setup) it will ignore the command.
