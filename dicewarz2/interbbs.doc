*****UPDATING YOUR LOCAL LIBRARIES******

Before you attempt to install the inter-BBS service, it is recommended that you
update your relative 'EXEC/' and 'EXEC/LOAD/' paths
with the latest files from the Synchronet CVS repository at:
	
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/
	
	RECOMMENDED UPDATES:
	
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/layout.js
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/inputline.js
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/funclib.js
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/calendar.js
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/event-timer.js
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/clock.js
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/scrollbar.js

*****SETTING UP INTER-BBS SERVICE WITH SYNCHRONET*****

The inter-BBS features of this program require that the appropriate services be configured, 
and that all of your files are up to date. The following files are needed to operate 
this program in inter-BBS mode, and can be downloaded from the Synchronet CVS repository at:

	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/

	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/json-service.js
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/json-db.js
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/exec/load/json-sock.js
	http://cvs.synchro.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/ctrl/json-service.ini
	
	NOTE: 	Placing these files in their corresponding local equivalent locations
			will make configuration much easier.

[JSON-CHAT.JS]

	This handles all inbound/outbound chat messages, and packages them for delivery.
	this also contains the necessary objects to implement a chat room (windowed or fullscreen). 
	
[JSON-DB.JS]
	
	This file acts as a JSON object database, which is used by JSON-SERVICE, but can be used 
	on the client side as well. 
	
[JSON-CLIENT.JS]

	This file is the gateway to the program's interbbs server. It contains the methods needed to lock, unlock,
	read, write and delete objects from the server database.
	
[JSON-SERVICE.JS]

	This file acts as an interbbs server. It contains the methods needed to lock, unlock,
	read, write and delete objects from the server database, and also accepts JSON-CLIENT connections
	and acts as the main source for all dynamic program data. The file contains instructions for
	setting up a server.
	
[JSON-SERVICE.INI]

	This file tells JSON-SERVICE.JS where a program's files are located.
	
	This file is critical for the service to operate properly. If you have installed the programs that 
	use this service to their default locations, no additional configuration should be required.
	
[SERVER.INI]

	This file should be located in the program's working directory, as it contains information for 
	the host and port the program will be connecting to. Deleting this file will cause
	your program not to function.
