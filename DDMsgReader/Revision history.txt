Revision History (change log)
=============================
Version  Date         Description
-------  ----         -----------
1.04     2015-10-10   - New feature: Users can now download attached files,
                      whether uploaded to their mailbox in Synchronet or
                      attached via internet email.
                      - New feature: Sysops can save a message to the BBS
                      machine (using the Ctrl-S key combo).
                      - User experience improvements: Added a pause after
                      saving a message so that the user can see Synchronet's
                      message save screen before going back to the reader or
                      message list.  Also, in the message list, PageDown now
                      goes to the last message when on the last page, and
                      similarly, PageUp goes to the first message when on the
                      first page.
                      - Updated the DDReadPersonalMail.js loadable module
                      script to start reading personal email in lister mode
                      by default, which is more in line with what Synchronet
                      does by default.  That will let the user select a message
                      to read first.
1.03     2015-07-12   Bug fix: In Linux, when replying to the last message in
                      a sub-board during a newscan or in read mode, it would
                      not immediately refresh the messagebase information, so
                      it would not see the new message posted.  This has been
                      fixed by closing the messagebase while the user is
                      posting a reply message and re-opening the messagebase
                      when the user is done posting the reply.
1.02     2015-06-10   Bug fix in DDScanMsgs.js: Switched to bbs.scan_msgs()
                      instead of bbs.scan_subs() for all other scan modes
                      besides SCAN_READ.  Updated the version number to
                      reflect that; no change to the actual reader.
1.01     2015-05-17   Bug fix: The enhanced reader header file is now correctly
                      displayed even if the lengths of its lines are
                      inconsistent.
1.00     2015-05-06   Initial release
