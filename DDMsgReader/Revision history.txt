Revision History (change log)
=============================
Version  Date         Description
-------  ----         -----------
1.06     2015-12-??   - Updated so that a sub-board new-message-scan (with the
                      -new_msg_scan_cur_sub command-line parameter) can make
                      use of the -subBoard command-line option to scan a
                      specific sub-board, which may be different than the
                      user's current sub-board.
                      - Bug fix: The configFilename command-line parameter was
                      not being read correctly on startup; this has been fixed.
                      - Bug fix: Doing a new-message-scan should now always
                      display the correct sub-board @-code information in the
                      header above the message.
1.05     2015-12-06   - Improved displaying of messages with ANSI codes.  The
                      reader now makes use of frame.js and scrollbar.js (in the
                      sync/exec/load directory) to enable a scrollable user
                      interface when displaying messages with ANSI content.
                      There is also a new configuration option,
                      readerInterfaceStyleForANSIMessages, which lets the sysop
                      configure whether to use a scrollable or traditional user
                      interface for ANSI messages.  The reason for that option
                      is in case ANSI messages don't look good when using
                      frame.js & scrollbar.js - When set to a traditional user
                      interface for ANSI messages, the reader will use a
                      non-scrolling user interface for displaying messages with
                      ANSI codes, which simply sends the message to the client
                      and lets the client display the ANSI content.
                      - More kludge lines displayed (with the 'K' key), and
                      all message header lines are now displayed (with the
                      'H' key).  This is a sysop feature.
                      - Color configuration options for the kludge/header line
                      labels (hdrLineLabelColor) and kludge/header line values
                      (hdrLineValueColor)
                      - Bug fix related to interpreting colors from other BBS
                      software (WWIV, PCBoard, Wildcat, Celerity, Renegade)
1.04     2015-10-10   - New feature: Users can now download attached files,
                      whether uploaded to their mailbox in Synchronet or
                      attached via internet email.
                      - New feature: Sysops can save a message to the BBS
                      machine (using the Ctrl-S key combo).
                      - User experience improvements: Added a pause after
                      saving a message so that the user can see Synchronet's
                      message save screen before going back to the reader or
                      message list.  Also, in the message list, PageDown now
                      goes to the last message when on the last page, and
                      similarly, PageUp goes to the first message when on the
                      first page.
                      - Updated the DDReadPersonalMail.js loadable module
                      script to start reading personal email in lister mode
                      by default, which is more in line with what Synchronet
                      does by default.  That will let the user select a message
                      to read first.
1.03     2015-07-12   Bug fix: In Linux, when replying to the last message in
                      a sub-board during a newscan or in read mode, it would
                      not immediately refresh the messagebase information, so
                      it would not see the new message posted.  This has been
                      fixed by closing the messagebase while the user is
                      posting a reply message and re-opening the messagebase
                      when the user is done posting the reply.
1.02     2015-06-10   Bug fix in DDScanMsgs.js: Switched to bbs.scan_msgs()
                      instead of bbs.scan_subs() for all other scan modes
                      besides SCAN_READ.  Updated the version number to
                      reflect that; no change to the actual reader.
1.01     2015-05-17   Bug fix: The enhanced reader header file is now correctly
                      displayed even if the lengths of its lines are
                      inconsistent.
1.00     2015-05-06   Initial release
