Revision History (change log)
=============================
Version  Date         Description
-------  ----         -----------
1.10     2016-02-19   Added a new configuration option,
                      readingPostOnSubBoardInsteadOfGoToNext, that affects what
                      happens after the user reads the last message on a
                      sub-board (for normal reading, not for newscans etc.): If
                      this is set to true, then the reader will prompt the user
                      if they want to post on the sub-board, then exit (this
                      is the stock Synchronet behavior).  If this is set to
                      false, then the reader will prompt the user whether to go
                      to the next sub-board after reading the last message on a
                      sub-board.  Also, added the postOnSubBoard text
                      configuration parameter for the theme filename, which
                      specifies the text to use for prompting the user if they
                      want to post on the sub-board after reading the last
                      message.
                      Added new configuration options areaChooserHdrFilenameBase
                      and areaChooserHdrMaxLines.  These options specify the
                      filename base for a header file to use for the message
                      area chooser list and the maximum number of lines to use
                      from the area chooser header file.  The filaname is
                      without the extension - The reader will first look for an
                      .ans version, then an .asc version.  Additionally,
                      multiple header files can be used for different terminal
                      widths - For example, chooserMsgHdr-80.ans for an
                      80-column terminal, choosrMsgHdr-140.ans for a 140-column
                      terminal, etc.
                      Updated so that when using the message written dates
                      (instead of the imported dates) in the message list & area
                      chooser, it will adjust the message written dates to the
                      BBS's local time zone so that they are all consistent.
1.09     2016-01-15   Updated to not center the message header lines
                      horizontally.  Now, it will display the header lines
                      starting on column 1.  This was done to fix a display
                      issue in some terminal software.
1.08     2016-01-10   Bug fix: When scanning message sub-boards, it wasn't
                      always closing the sub-board when there were no new
                      messages, resulting in further sub-boards failing to open
                      after a while.  That has been fixed.
1.07     2015-12-24   - Added the ability to select multiple messages (for
                      actions such as batch delete), and added the ability to
                      delete multiple selected messages.  Batch deleting is
                      only allowed when the user has permission to delete
                      messages (such as their own personal email).  Messages
                      can be selected in the following ways:
                        o Lightbar message list: The spacebar selects an
                          individual message.  CTRL-A lets the user select or
                          un-select all messages.
                        o Traditional message list: The S key lets the user
                          select or un-select messages, by typing message
                          numbers, A to select all, or N to select none
                          (un-select all).  The list of message numbers is
                          comma-separated or space-separated, allowing
                          for number ranges such as 120-130 for instance.
                        o Reader interface: The spacebar selects the message.
                      To delete the selected messages, the user must be in the
                      message list; the CTRL-D key combo is used for batch
                      delete, and it will prompt the user for confirmation
                      before deleting the messages.
                      - Added the following configurable items in the theme
                      file:
                      delSelectedMsgsConfirmText
                      selectedMsgsDeletedText
                      cannotDeleteAllSelectedMsgsText
                      selectedMsgMarkColor
1.06     2015-12-13   - Updated so that a sub-board new-message-scan (with the
                      new_msg_scan_cur_sub command-line parameter) can make
                      use of the -subBoard command-line option to scan a
                      specific sub-board, which may be different than the
                      user's current sub-board.
                      - Added a new configuration option, pauseAfterNewMsgScan,
                      which specifies whether or not to pause (i.e., with a
                      "finished" message) after doing a new message scan.
                      - Bug fix: The configFilename command-line parameter was
                      not being read correctly on startup; this has been fixed.
                      - Bug fix: Doing a new-message-scan should now always
                      display the correct sub-board @-code information in the
                      header above the message.
1.05     2015-12-06   - Improved displaying of messages with ANSI codes.  The
                      reader now makes use of frame.js and scrollbar.js (in the
                      sync/exec/load directory) to enable a scrollable user
                      interface when displaying messages with ANSI content.
                      There is also a new configuration option,
                      readerInterfaceStyleForANSIMessages, which lets the sysop
                      configure whether to use a scrollable or traditional user
                      interface for ANSI messages.  The reason for that option
                      is in case ANSI messages don't look good when using
                      frame.js & scrollbar.js - When set to a traditional user
                      interface for ANSI messages, the reader will use a
                      non-scrolling user interface for displaying messages with
                      ANSI codes, which simply sends the message to the client
                      and lets the client display the ANSI content.
                      - More kludge lines displayed (with the 'K' key), and
                      all message header lines are now displayed (with the
                      'H' key).  This is a sysop feature.
                      - Color configuration options for the kludge/header line
                      labels (hdrLineLabelColor) and kludge/header line values
                      (hdrLineValueColor)
                      - Bug fix related to interpreting colors from other BBS
                      software (WWIV, PCBoard, Wildcat, Celerity, Renegade)
1.04     2015-10-10   - New feature: Users can now download attached files,
                      whether uploaded to their mailbox in Synchronet or
                      attached via internet email.
                      - New feature: Sysops can save a message to the BBS
                      machine (using the Ctrl-S key combo).
                      - User experience improvements: Added a pause after
                      saving a message so that the user can see Synchronet's
                      message save screen before going back to the reader or
                      message list.  Also, in the message list, PageDown now
                      goes to the last message when on the last page, and
                      similarly, PageUp goes to the first message when on the
                      first page.
                      - Updated the DDReadPersonalMail.js loadable module
                      script to start reading personal email in lister mode
                      by default, which is more in line with what Synchronet
                      does by default.  That will let the user select a message
                      to read first.
1.03     2015-07-12   Bug fix: In Linux, when replying to the last message in
                      a sub-board during a newscan or in read mode, it would
                      not immediately refresh the messagebase information, so
                      it would not see the new message posted.  This has been
                      fixed by closing the messagebase while the user is
                      posting a reply message and re-opening the messagebase
                      when the user is done posting the reply.
1.02     2015-06-10   Bug fix in DDScanMsgs.js: Switched to bbs.scan_msgs()
                      instead of bbs.scan_subs() for all other scan modes
                      besides SCAN_READ.  Updated the version number to
                      reflect that; no change to the actual reader.
1.01     2015-05-17   Bug fix: The enhanced reader header file is now correctly
                      displayed even if the lengths of its lines are
                      inconsistent.
1.00     2015-05-06   Initial release
