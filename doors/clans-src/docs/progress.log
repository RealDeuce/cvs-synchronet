Wed 1-21-98

 * worked on event files and NPCs
 * done eventfiles and scripts

Sun 1-25-98

 * did NPC (/) Chatter but need to test --> work on maintenance
 ! Currently working on maintenance

Sat 1-31-98
 * desperately need to check out D:\telemate\download\clans\clans.pc to see if
   the users get negative experience or something like that when they reach
   levels around 50
 * need to work on empires and IBBS still and misc. menus

Tue 2-17-98
 * REMEMBER THIS:  Make sure you get rid of ALL od_printf's since they
   consume memory!!!
 * user encryption for ally.dat

Thu 2-19-98
 - all that's left: some REP's and IBBS
 - also, empires
 * new reset program
 - fix problem with points?
 - empire attacks still needs work (formulas)

Sun 3-1-98
 * Be more consistent with Config->InterBBS, Game.Data->InterBBS, etc.
   actually, should use Game.Data->InterBBS since other two can be changed
   by config file.

Mon 3-2-98
 * make reset send packets and all that crap
 * maybe tell sysop to run clans /in /out or something like that to get
   reset going properly...
 * don't show game stats if game has not yet started!!!
 - have each packet have a datestamp
  -- now, if the packet is received AND it turns out to be greater than X
     days old, treat it as if it was a lost packet.  That is, do NOT process
     it.  Skip it.  Now, the sender will wait say X+2 days until restoring
     lost packets (i.e. armies or clanmoves).  This should prevent multiple
     players and lost data!
 - bug just realized:
     subuser and deluser act EXACTLY THE SAME!!  DelUser should only remove
     the user from the BBS and SubUser should remove him from League
     completely!  But, it turns out SubUser and DelUser both remove from
     the league.  So if a user is duped, he is removed from league, ok maybe
     that's the way it was meant to be actually...

misc. ibbs stuff:
        other packet types..

 * large problem: if reset is sent by LC, boards will not reset their village
   data... what else can be incorrect one must wonder... :)
 - convert all fopens to _fsopens
 - problem: what if village.dat is corrupt and a reset is sent? -- only way to
   fix it is to run reset.exe!!!  solution: DO NOT CORRUPT VILLAGE.DAT :)
 - implement PT_OKUSER packet
 - what's left:
        * int'l attacking
        * int'l spying
        * newndx
        * deleting of clans
        o new empire formulae
 - make game create files other than TMP.$$$ (unique filename)
 * get rid of od_printfs
 * in reset, tell user to type CLANS /I if it's an IBBS game to finish off
   reset procedure
 - ensure there are NO warnings
 - game sometimes hangs in battle!!!!
 * add /Recon X and /SendReset X to game (simple)
 - edit pcedit.exe

 * default flag is blank
 * add help for that other option (forgot which one)
 * misc. colours are wrong
 * protection in stats
 * user written twice and updated twice!!
 * deleted users are still in scorefile!  --> because of old packets...

Sat 3-14-98
 * send userlist to new BBS joining the league
 * send userlist every X days...
   * send new scorefile too?

bugs:
 * game says The game was reset! twice
 * make it so that when reset run without config, it'll say run CONFIG.EXE
   first.
 - new empire formula?
 - remove lc.log?
 - remove all cheats
 - user editor WHICH ALLOWS CHANGING OF NAMES and such


Yer there's a way to get seven people in your party temporarily by
haveing the sysop make it so u get six and once in the game get rid of a
character then get a npc, now u should have 6, then go to the training
hall and get another character.


  3rdly and more seriously someone on my bbs discovered that they can double
  their items, by taking their items from the donation room, then dropping
  carrier and when they return the items are both in their possession and 
  still in the donation room...

> 2ndly people have noticed a few bugs when dropping carrier, 1stly that
  they can avoid dying in a fight by dropping... hard to fix especially when
  people could drop by accident..

> like crazy just in one loss.  I once destroyed over 50 towers, 7 barracks,
> and more in one day using 5 empire fights.

- charisma is useless!

* BBSID not set in local games


- finish up jap secret
* make it so game DOES NOT allow packets to bogus BBS IDs
* add flag so it doesn't create netmail, just packets
* crashes Win95 and reset.exe GPF's
* status of reset not saved!
* attacks don't return properly (??)
* cdev kit doesn't work with monsters!
- make the game write out league scores to file

may 31
- add on ibbs.log again
- player's clans are being disbanded by league.  destroying disband.dat
  fixes it
* bbses 30-32 aren't getting packets in league of 32
- dupe clans being made
* make updates more often (Clan_Update) write after fights and empire wars
- beef up village security
- allow clans to join to protect village somehow?
- disallow useage of |08 for all colours?
* clans who travel during reset return AFTER reset
& route.cfg DOESN'T supersede host method!


wed jun 24, '98
* fix initialization problem (.Initialized = TRUE set BEFORE we even checkmem() it!)
* fixed leaving.dat problem, users leaving before reset would return after it (perhaps why we have
  users deleted??!?!?)
* return lost attacks!!
* fixed problem empire attack problem (didn't return properly)
* made BBS listing wider
* clans dead are NOT listed as dead sometimes
* make sure users can't join past lastjoin date
 * REMEMBER THIS:  Make sure you get rid of ALL od_printf's since they
   consume memory!!!

Going through files to see what is missing and noting it below.
