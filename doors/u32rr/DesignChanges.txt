This is an overview of game design changes from the original Usurper pascal
source code:

Memory mapped files
===================
IPC data will be transferred using memory-mapped files instead of read/write
on the same files.  So far this is simplifying the code, but the
synchronization method has not yet been settled, but POSIX semaphores in the
mmap region is most likely.  Possibly each record will have a separate
semaphore.

Output
======
The output is intended to be line-wrapped progamatically rather than hard coded
line lengths.  This allows much better flexability.  However, the current text
reads very choppy, so this retrofit may take a very long time.
