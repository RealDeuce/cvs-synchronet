`0 First of all, I'm not an artist.  So if my Room screens bug you or you
`0 would just rather not see them, the global command "X" during the game
`0 will toggle the room ANSI's on and off.

`2 The story is simple.  You were minding your own business one day and
`2 suddenly found yourself in the distant future, in a Hanger where you
`2 could travel to the past.  You aren't alone, many other recruits are
`2 here also.

*
`2 The object of the game is to survive and progress.  This is really very
`2 self-explanatory.  You can kill mutants to gain money and experience, and
`2 you can even kill each other.

`2 Be sure to use the [I]nventory global command.  This is how you heal
`2 yourself, once you buy a Health Crystal.  As this game expands, your
`2 inventory will become increasingly important as the amount of items you
`2 have access to will increase.

`3 Note: This game is "complete" in the fact that aside from any bugs that
`3 might exist, you should be able to win the game (after your Sysop sends
`3 the Registration fee).  However, I hope to expand it very soon, add more
`3 features and options, then begin on IGM's (whole new time periods).  In
`3 addition to the Times built-in, an Unregistered Time Port will support up
`3 to 3 more IGM's.  When registered, the game will read up to 26 of them.
