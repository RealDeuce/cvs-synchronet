v0.10 WIDE BETA 1
=================

This is basically the beta 3 release I have had little time to work on it,
but the game itself seems to be stable. The InterBBS is having problems but
with a limited beta sites I have not gotten enough feedback ... only from
one site on which it didn't work.

Features:

- InterBBS play, read INTERBBS.DOC for more info on how to participate in
  an InterBBS game. It works only with registered sysops. You can now
  interact with other BBSes, through fido type mail networks. I will work on
  an Internet options, though it might not be hard to set it up even now.
  Local IBBS games can also be set up, with fake node numbers (1:1/1 ...)
- There are one new command line option linked to the InterBBS, -IBBSM,
  see INTERBBS.DOC for more info!
- NYIBBS.EXE is added for the interbbs processing, Look at INTERBBS.DOC for
  info.
- RIP is here ... that's the major improvement in this version! 
- Two screen saving levels now, if a person is given an online message or
  something similiar happens, the screen is saved and then restored ... same
  as with chat. Now you can chat AND the user can be in a screen saving event
  all at the same time ... won't corrupt screen if more then two levels are
  entered.
- Few new enemies. Not many but a few.
- Full screen chat mode much like KewlChat 1.2, even supports RIP(remote
  graphics only though, locally it looks like ANSI)!...
- Three abilities throwing,punching,kicking. For throwing the player needs
  a rock. This can only be found in one of the events. The initial abilities
  for exeisting users are set to be distributed evenly (since they already
  had level raises and existing users also get 2 rocks free). Each level
  raise the user can pick one ability to increase by 4. These abilities
  can be used in all fights!
- User File structure changed, but used the reserved bits so no is conversion
  neccessary. Existing users will get default values of the abilities.
- User Stats is much faster, but it takes a bit more memory.
- Removed the -AD command line option. Auto terminal detection is now the
  default.
- Added -NAD command line option. Disables the auto terminal detection.
- Added -RIP switch, forces RIP even if the user does not have RIP.
- Messed with the Maintanance, it will be a little slower, but safer for mail.
- The editor now edits all the new values (the abilities)
- Added -MM argument. Forces maintanance even if it was run that day already,
  does not check! Will force a new day on all players! Use only if you know
  what you are doing. Good if you want to test the game, or if you are just
  trying the game and want to test it as a several days game ...
- When local mode is invoked with the -l option a better display and
  prompt is used.
- There are two main menus in the menu files, it's the one iwth the interbbs
  option. And there is also the interbbs menu.
- Compiled with a new version of OpenDoors (v6.00)
- The struct.doc file updated to display the new file structure.
- 3rdparty.doc updated.
- The IGMs can now read/write the new values into the text character file.
- Sex turns not being decremented on user rapes bug fixed.
- Recompiled the Editor, and made a few fixes made it faster and safer.
- When no dropfile found the game displays it's own no dropfile msg instead of
  default opendoors one.
- Screen not cleared on exit if the login was not with the "-L" argument.
- Optimized menus, saved 10k
- Optimized online fights, saved 8k
- New trimming routine.
- User names from the local login prompt are now trimmed of uneccessary
  spaces.

Bugs:
- Fixed a file finding and opening bug ...
- Fixed a stack overflow bug which i'm not sure if it occured in v0.05 ...
- Fixed a bug not deleting all dead user's messages ... Revamped the deleting
  part completely, making it a tiny bit slower, but MUCH MUCH safer.
- Small Local name input bug fixed. (local logon)
- Several display bugs fixed!
- "?" didn't work in drugs menu.
- Craps is spelled Crabs ...:) sorry bout this. file structures not changed
  because of this though
- The idle time time slicing now actually really works ... so multitasker
  support is now much much better then before.
- The "-p" command line argument now works right for NYEDIT
- Online fights should now cause more problems if an online message is sent to
  that node!

v0.10 BETA 1-3 (The above is a compilation of the new features in those
releases The Wide BETA 1 is the BETA 3 release basicaly)

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
The 0.0? series releases
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

v0.06 (alpha release of v0.10 on my bbs only!)
==============================================

Look at v0.10 for features ... 0.06 was the marking for all the v0.10 alpha
versions, since they were on my bbs only. 0.06 did not have the complete
feature list. Was never released on any BBS but mine.

v0.05a (very minor release)
===========================

Features:
- The game can now autodetect the terminal emulation type, just use the
  -AD command line option.

v0.05 (Minor Release)
=====================

Features:
- Created my own copyfile and delete routines so the game does not call dos
  anymore (xcept to run IGMs).
- New in game events that happen practically anywhere in the game. They
  happen sparsely though.
- The polling value can now be edited. So you can fine-tune your multitasker!
  Make sure you use the new .cfg file! or copy the "PollingValue" keyword into 
  your .cfg file if you wish to change it!

Bugs:

  rape if he already used up all his sex turns.
- If a user does not have any hits of his drug it does not tell him he has to
  sell it.
- Checks for flags during fights only every second, not all the time!

Bugs:
- If user said no to "you'll have to sell all yer hits of your currnt drug"
  it changed the drug anywayz.
- Very minor display bugs fixed.
- Again a fix in the file checking during idle, it didn't check untill a
  key was pressed!

CheatFixes:

  It was strange but only worked for higher level users!

v0.03c (Bugfixes only)
======================

Bugs:
- Command line reading bug fixed! The one with the -p argument. This one
  was a hard to find but I GOT IT!

- Not checking for online messages durning idle bug fixed (multinode only).

===========================

Features:
- Send money through mail option added (in bank)! This added 4 lines to the
  lines.dat file.
- Finally made the menu capitalization constant and went and capitalized all
  menu items (menus.dat).
- Very small display changes in a few places.

Bugs:
- Few misspellings and linguistic errors fixed.

v0.03 (Minor Release)
======================

Features:
- NY2008.CFG was renamed to SAMPLE.CFG to avoid overwriting during unzip.
  (if you have not had ny2008 instaled before, copy this file to NY2008.CFG!)
- New, more user friendly, registration program, same name, REGISTER.EXE
- Editor now includes Levels/Minimum Points table when you enter points
- The NYEDIT.EXE is smaller about 35k or so!
- New command line parameter, RESET, which will reset the game, instead of
  the old RESET.BAT! (works with multiple game setups and you can include a
  .CFG file using the "-C" parameter.
- It is now faster in multitasking enviroment since it does not check for
  flags that often during idle anymore.
- Added "CheckFlagsEvery" keyword to SAMPLE.CFG file so you can edit exactly
  how often does NY2008 check for other nodes messages during idle. Read
  the SAMPLE.CFG file for more info!
- No-Self-Mail checking finally works ...
- Message automatically aborted if nothing in the body and user does not want
  to have sex.
- "Nothing happened" displayed if newzfiles not found or found empty
  (this added 2 lines to lines.dat, and linesc.dat)
- The bps rate is not read in, if a fossil is used. This should solve some
  communication problems.
- "-RDBPS" comand line option added. Makes the game read the locked bps!
  use only if you have problems
- Users can't change their drug when they're high. they gotta sober up first!
  (1 more line in lines.dat (and linesc.dat) file)
- If a player looses in an offline player fight he looses all his money on
  hand

Bugs:
- An overflow bug fixed when buying drugs when the user had a LOT of money.
  (It would mess up the users money and points)
- Offline player fight bug fixed if maintanance ran on another node.
- RIP users should be allright now (used to be some display garbage).
- Also RIP users might have gotten ASCII not ANSI... I fixed that too
- [F9] did not work if Standard personality was chosen in the .cfg file
- In editor, when entering points only numbers can be entered.
- In editor, a small statusline display bug fixed.
- Few misspellings fixed.
- Alt keys did not work if NY2008 personality was chozen in the .cfg file.
- A lot of display bugs fixed (it just looks a bit better now).

Known maybe-bugs:
- A user got "agreed and had sex with you" from a male player, I could not
  duplicate it. Only one system reported it. Strange. I looked through all
  parts that posted messages and all parts that recieved and could not find
  something that would put a had sex with you flag on ... I think it must
  have gotten corrupted somehow from defeated you message ...
- "You are being fought node" bug still not caught, if it is a bug. It looks
  like the flag might be left in place after an error or a sys-crash. It
  might not be a bug and might not even be caused by the game. If you
  turn of multinode support or run crash recovery during maintanance each
  day it should not ever come up anywayz. (I'm strongly convinced it is not
  a bug but something that happened with my board)
  (NOTE: Fixed in v0.05)

v0.02 (Minor Release)
=====================

Features:
- IGMs can be in fights as events. Just add the IGM's you want to be available
  as fight events into a file called '3RDEVENT.DAT'. The format is the same as
  '3RDPARTY.DAT'.
- New IGM Installation program that implements the fight event igms. It's in
  the main archive in (NY_IGMIN.ZIP, same as before).
- Franz's Bar has a minor release, with afew bugfixes and the new installation
  program (NY_BAR12.ZIP).
- The checking for flags is faster, so the game should be a bit faster now.
- The "1 File Copied" message is not displayed localy anymore.
- Personalities can be changed even when a user is online.
- New personality called "NY2008" which will display player status, like points
  and money. From this status line you can switch to any other personality.
  If you want "NY2008" personality online press Alt-[F1].

Bugs:
- Mail name searching bug fixed!
- If user has enough money to buy an A-Bomb but isn't level 20, it tells him
  before it kicks him back to menu.
- A bug in IGM prompt fixed, nothing major.
- Few small display bugs fixed

v0.01 (Major Release)
=====================

Features:
- The maintanance should now take about 2,000,000,000 messages without
  crashing (theoretically).
- Can have infinite number of IGMs now. If you use the OTHER.ANS, .ASC, .AVT
  screen to override the default display, only one screen is used so the
  numbers of the IGM in the 3rdparty.dat is the number to enter to run the
  igm, if other.a?? is not used it's allways 1-20 on infinite number of pages.
- IGM display faster due to pre-formatting the 3rdparty.dat each play into
  a temporary binary file which is read from the disk to save memory.
- "Q", "?" are now hotkeyd in IGM menu, along with the new Next and Previous
  commands (only active when there is more than 20 igms).
- Rank number and inactivity days are no longer read from igm dropfiles,
  to prevent errors.
- New text file character information dropfile for IGM's so that the non-C
  programmers can make IGM's easier. (read 3rdparty.doc for more info!)
- If 3rdmnt.bat is found in the game dir it will be executed after the
  nightly maintanance if you need to run something everynight.
- If the screen length is not read properly it's reset to 24 lines
- Custom Installation Program is included in the main archive
- Franz's Bar and Jackpot IGM's have 1.1 releases (NY_BAR11.ZIP and NY_JP11.ZIP)
- New IGM called Shoot Em is released! (NY_SHOOT.ZIP)

Bugs:
- Few Display bugs fixed.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

WIDE BETA 9
===========

Features:
- Killed the turning cursor on the mail search thing ... I put it in there
  partly cuz it looked good but it slowed the mail search down about 60 to
  100 timez! So I took it out <G> Sorry that was in there and ya had to put
  up with it but that just happens. Now it just says "Searching ..." and
  that's it.

  it fer ya.
- On exit from IGM it now checks the deadly percentages and if user hasn't
  been killed properly in the igm it will kill him with the usual die message.

- You can restrict players ability to get into IGM's by security level.
  Do this by putting '{<minimum security level>}' into the command line of
  the IGM.
- You can have a custom display of available IGM's by creating a file
  called OTHER.ASC, OTHER.ANS and OTHER.AVT (you don't have to make all of
  them, but they will be displayed to user if available and his termonal
  allows).
- The drop files for IGM's format has changed a bit .... there are two more
  fields, terminal emulation and user location! Sorry about this! It will be
  easy to change that and since I don't think there's a single IGM out there
  except the one I just wrote I don't think it will affect anything.
- I made an IGM! It's a very simple JACKPOT IGM and the filename is
  NY_JPIGM.ZIP (I will release the source soon ... I have to clean it up
  first.)
