There are several Distro and Support BBSes.

Right now I only kept the international and internet distro sites on the list.

Also my bbs is no longer online!

To reach me do the following:

  Send me internet e-mail to: franz@azstarnet.com

The filenaming convention is:

NY_???.ZIP
   ^^^
    \--the version number

(e.g. NY_013.ZIP for v0.13)
(e.g. NY_010W2.ZIP for v0.10 WIDE BETA 2)

Here's the official distro site list:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Internet:
  
 FTP:
  ftp.uniserve.com

  empire.bbs.net.au

Here's the old distro site list:

I'm no longer keeping a list of the distro bbses since it was too much work
and didn't pay off much .... you can be a distro bbs but will not be listed
anywhere. If you register and have an e-mail address you will be notified of
new releases as they come out! the existing list will be as it is with no more
additions, (unless I feel otherwise:)

Here they are:

Tucson, AZ:
  Franz's BBS               DISCONNECTED      1200-28800
  My own BBS ... single node and requires CBV to verify. But it will allways
  have the most recent version. Even before anybody else. And it's the 
  fastest way to reach me.

  (note up and running again, check above)
  Partners For Peace  node1:DISCONNECTED      14400
                      node2:DISCONNECTED
  This is a 2 node BBS that also requires verification, but it's easier to 
  reach since it's 2 node. This is not a good way to reach me, but I upload
  the newest version here as soon as it comes out. Testing Wildcat.
  You can FREQ here under NY2008 or any filename (if you know it).
