I have a lot of feature requests, but NO donations, so i'm pretty lazy on
working on the door, I add just simple features. These are planed but I
prolly won't do it unless I get some donations.

up to 30 questions, 15 two liened (but it would be flexible, like 10 2-lined
and 10 1-lined)

more editting capabilities.

RIP

multiple question files

User editor

color options

more user specific options

badwords replacement file

More ...

But since i don't right now feel any need to add something i won't ... I'd
rather work on something i get some money for (and i don't have much of that
too!) So even a small donation will get me more motivated to work on it!
