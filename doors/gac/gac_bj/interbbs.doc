; INTERBBS.DOC - Sample Inter-BBS configuration file
;
; If you wish to use this file, rename it to INTERBBS.CFG and edit it.
;
; Any text following a semi-colon (;), and blank lines, are ignored.
;
; The league coordinator should gather the list of BBS's participating
; in this Tournament and the needed information ( e.g. node number, 
; location, name), choose a league ID (two letter), create/edit this file, 
; and use the SENDCONFIG command line parameter to pass the INTERBBS.CFG
; file to all systems listed in the League.  Those systems will automatically
; recognize the incoming message and update the INTERBBS.CFG file on the 
; remote system, as long as that system is configured for the correct league
; ID.
;
; You may even list the configuration options in this file, and the settings
; given here will override the local systems configuration.  This will insure
; that all of the BBS's in the league are setup identically.
;
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; This section is to allow the League Coodinator to override all of the 
; local configuration options for this League.  This will insure that every
; BBS is setup identically.  If you do not want to override local options,
; comment these lines out with a semi-colon (;).

; List of other systems running the door, which the door should be linked to.
; For each system, the LinkWith, LinkNumber, LinkName and LinkLocation lines 
; should be grouped together in order. The LinkWith line should specify the 
; system's node address, the LinkNumber line is the number for this system
; in the current league, the LinkName line should specify the system's name, 
; and the LinkLocation line should specify the location of the system.
