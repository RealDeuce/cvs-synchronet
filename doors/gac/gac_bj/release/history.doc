Version 2.00  MAJOR RE-WRITE WITH MAJOR CHANGES, 
              REQUIRES ALL BOARDS USE 2.00 or ABOVE
        - Uses Open Doors 6.0, so the command line parameters have changed.
        - New Full screen editor with word-wrap and quoting!
        - Full sized cards for the player's and dealer's hands and still 
          maintains all multinode operations (including chat).
        - No more use of encoded NetMail for Inter-BBS.  Operates identical 
          to Inter-LORD and VERY similiar to BRE's HOST routing system.  You
          will have to MANUALLY send the NEW INTERBBS.CFG file to all
          systems the first time.
        - Includes ability to route files from one system to another.
        - Now includes the ability to generate routing reports which display
          route times of the league, version information and more
        - Now has seperate INBOUND, OUTBOUND and MAINTAIN routines that do
          NOT have to be run when netmail is received.
        - Much smaller packet sizes
        - Auto Reset bug squashed
        

Version 1.23
        - No longer necessary to reset your game when changing the bbs
          number from 0 (a local game) to another number.  It is done auto-
          matically during the nightly maintenance.
Version 1.22
        - Will NOT PAUSE any longer when the SysOp runs inbound.
        - Fixed the problem with displaying the incorrect amount of money
          the player will be given the next day.  (Caused by chaning all 
          values to unsigned long integers in the previous release)
        - Correctly displays the user's choosen alias everywhere in the game
          where a user name is used
Version 1.21
        - Fixed a problem with Stack Overflows (memory limitations)
        - Now IGNORES information from BBSs no longer in the current
          INTERBBS.CFG file.
        - REQUIRES the INTERBBS.CFG file to be sent to a NEW member manually
          (e.g. through a file attache).  This is done as a security
          precaution, to insure that a BBS does not receive an INTERBBS.CFG
          file from an invalid source.
Version 1.20 ** This version requires a league reset and each person MUST be
             ** Using Version 1.14 or above in the league
        - Fixed a problem with creating Top 15 BBS Bulletin
        - Isolated a problem with incorrect score listings

        - Sent messages are now smaller in size and can contain colors
Version 1.13
        - Fixed a problem with displaying large sums of money, everything has
          been converted to unsigned long integers
        - Added the SENDALL command line parameter, which will allow a SysOp
          to send a message to ALL other SysOps in the Inter-BBS Leagues
          using the simple built in editor, default routing is used.
Version 1.12
        - Fixed a problem with not sending all lines of a message to the
          other player.
        - Players can now abort a message they started writing
        - Changed ANSI to show the abort possibility
Version 1.11

Version 1.1

          viewed the Top Players list.
        - Added some new score listings to the Scores menu including top
          BBSs by total score, scores for an individual BBS etc...
        - Changed the BBS score listings so it now shows ALL BBSs in the
          League, even if there are no players in the database for that BBS
        - We now politely inform users that their game is not part of an
          Inter-BBS game when run with BBS number equal to 0.  It used to
          display garbage to some users.
        - Added the ability for a local BBS to reset their game, even if in
          a League.
        - Changed the Players in Current Game prompt to Players in On-Line 
          Game to avoid confusion.
        - Changed the ANSI to correspond to the above menu option.
        - Shortened the display of scores by one line to avoid scrolling on
          the local side.
        - Updated some of the internal Inter-BBS functions
        - Changed some of the internal memory cofigurations to run more 
          efficiently

Version 1.0 First Official Release
        - Fixed a problem with not updating players last day on, and awarding
          daily money.
        - Fixed a problem with initializing the Inter-BBS information
        - Changed some of the prompts to be more informative to users
        - Changed it so the user's handle is displayed on-line instead of
          his/her real name.
        - Fixed a problem with displaying final results on multinode systems
        - Fixed a few typos
Version .091 beta
        - Fixed a memory allocation bug that occured when a user tried to 
          send messages on some systems.
Version .09 beta
        - Performs checks on the user Handles to insure that there is only
          one user with a given handle on each BBS.
        - Will no longer allow blank handles to be used
        - Users can now send telegrams to each other and other BBSs.  Quoting
          is not allowed and message sizes are limited to help control the 
          size of files sent.
        - The current day is now stored seperately so it can be updated even
          when there aren't any players playing
        - Now only one netmail is sent to each system for the Player data, and
          one netmail for all messages to that system
        - Added new options in the INTERBBS.CFG file that will insure all
          systems are setup using the identical configuration.
        - Removed the NetMail configuration options from the Inter-BBS.CFG 
          file and placed them in the normal configuration program.
        - Added the RESET command line feature that will allow the League
          Coordinator to reset the Inter-BBS game at any time.
        - Added a SENDCONFIG command line feature which will send the
          INTERBBS.CFG file to all BBS systems in the league.  Those systems
          will automatically import the new INTERBBS.CFG file and save their
          old one as INTERBBS.OLD file.  ANY size of file can be sent, since
          it will automatically be broke into parts and reassembled at the
          destination.  Only the League Coordinator (BBS #1) can send the
          file out.
        - Changed some of the filenames, so all documentation has a .DOC 
          extension.
        - Corrected documentation errors and modified some areas (e.g. SHARE
          must be loaded for all users, and the maintain function has changed)
        - Corrected the Inbound Inter-BBS routines.  The problem was some BBSs
          do NOT accurately record the Zone and Point addresses.  The default
          method now ignores the zone and point for more compatability
        - The MAINTAIN command line switch now processes Inbound messages,
          updates the files, and processes outbound messages (if in an
          Inter-BBS league).  It is now NOT necessary to run GAC_BJ INBOUND
          with every mail drop, unless you want messages imported immediately
        - Added Renegade, and Synchronet to Supported BBS systems listed in 
          doc files
        - Removed the reference to the Max number of messages, since it is no
          longer used.
        - Added a check to insure that only newer Inter-BBS messages will 
          update the information in the PLAYER.DAT file
        - Fixed a problem with the display of the BBS scores
        - Fixed a problem with the Top 15 BBS bulletins
        - Fixed a couple of typos in the prompts
Version .08
        - Solved all problems with Inter-BBS functions (hope anyway)
        - Disabled the screen clearing when maintenance and inbound routines
          are run.  Allows the sysop to see what has happened.
        - Had to re-convert all the code back to Borland to make the inter-bbs
          functions work correctly
        - Removed the ANSIs from the internal memory pool to lower memory 
          requirements
        - Optimized the searching for *.MSG files in MAINTAIN mode
        - Fixed an internal file handling problem (wrong number of bytes)
        - Added an option to config the maximum file number (*.MSG) to search 
          for in the netmail directory (NOT USED NOW...GO FIGURE)
        - Changed the status line help line to explain the rest of the
          function keys
        - Made the config program fancier w/pop up boxes
        - Changed some of the configuration descriptions in GAC_BJ CONFIG to
          make it clearer.
        - Corrected the way the program processes outbound and inbound file
          numbering.  Should end the memory allocation errors associated with
          the spawn functions
        - Corrected some documentation errors
        - Corrected the game automatically resetting even when the Tournament
          length was set to 0 (indicating no resets)
        - Corrected more memory problems
Version .07 
        - Corrected some memory problems

Version .06 alpha
        - Fixed the bug that was causing TBJ to ignore the command line
                door path paramter (no need to edit GAC_BJ.CFG now)
        - Fixed a couple of problems with the inbound routines.  I still
                don't know if these are working correctly.  Outbound looks
                good
        - Fixed some problems with memory (mainly freeing and allocating)
