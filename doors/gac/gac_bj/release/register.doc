Well with this version I have totally changed the way that registration
is taking place.

GAC Software is now POSTCARD ware. That is if you send me a (NICE) Postcard
from your hometown or state I will send you a personalized registration.
So more or less you can own a REGISTERED copy of GAC_BJ for the price
of a Stamp and a post card.

When I took over for Greg he did not give me the database of
registered users, So if you are a registered user I am sorry but I want
a postcard from you as well. (Note: you do not have to upgrade)

I will be hanging these up in my daughters room. (Turns out that she
loves postcards) so the "cuter" the better. If you choose to send me in
one of the United States Postal Service (El' Cheepo') Cards then I am
sorry but if I have time I will write RETURN TO SENDER on it and put it
back in my mail box, if I do not have the time I will just rip it up.

Come on. Take the time to get a nice one and send it to me. I will
promise you that it will not cost you more than the $10(US) that
Gac Blackjack used to cost.

On the Card I will need the following:

      Name:
      Bbsname:
      Game that you want to register:
      Email:
      Comments:
 
      (As well as if you have)
      BBS Phone:
      Fido Number:

And I will send you YOUR Registration Number. If you have Fido I will
send it Crashmail if you do not then I will send it via EMail or postal.

If you would like a personlized disk please send in your postcard in an
envelope with 1.00 in it. (it is .55 to send a disk and the rest will go
to my "I HAVE A DOLLAR" fund.

Please mail the postcard or envelope to:

  Vagabond Software
  12235 China Lake
  Dallas Texas 75253
  USA


I am sure that Brianna (My Daughter) will love you for it.
