Tournament FreeCell Leagues

This file is a text version of what is available on our web site 
(http://rampages.onramp.net/~campbel).  The purposes of this file are to 
present new users with information about joining an existing league and
give league coordinators a place to advertise their league.  

If you are starting a new league, please fill out the blank form and send it 
back to us.  We will update the web site asap and this file will be updated
in the next release.
