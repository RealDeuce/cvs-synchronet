 o How about we skip the junk for once, and lets be reasonable. There's     o
 o only one reason you're reading this manual...                            o
 o                                                                          o
 o Make a directory somewhere, anywhere, your choice, but preferably a dir  o
 o within your bbs directory...                                             o
 o                                                                          o
 o        C:\BBS\> md smurf                                                 o
 o        C:\BBS\> cd smurf                                                 o
 o        C:\BBS\SMURF\>                                                    o
 o                                                                          o
 o Now from there you unzip (or copy) these files into the new directory... o
 o                                                                          o
 o        C:\BBS\SMURF\> copy c:\dloads\temp\*.*                            o

 o                                                                          o
 o Now, from the DOS prompt type in the following to create a proper batch  o
 o file in order to run the program:                                        o
 o                                                                          o
 o        C:\BBS\SMURF\> smurf setup                                        o
 o                                                                          o
 o Now, enter in the appropriate directories requested, and the setup will  o
 o create a batch file called SMURF.BAT within the specified bbs directory. o
 o                                                                          o
 o Now, go into your onliners edit program or what not and simply add in    o
 o the name Smurf Combat (Play me, SECURITY INCREASE **everytime**) <heh>   o
 o and put the file name or chain file to run as "SMURF", without quotes,   o
 o of course. If possible, SHRINK the BBS to run!! And also, do NOT use DOS o
 o interupts (the selection).                                               o
 o                                                                          o
 o Now all you have to do is save and run...                                o
 o                                                                          o
