Program Information:
 BBS Door  - Space Dynasty Elite (SDE)
 Author    - 1999-2004 by Darryl Perry, All Rights Reserved

What is it Space Dynasty Elite:
	Space Dynasty Elite is a linux implementation of a WWIV BBS online game
	called Space Dynasty.  Space Dynast was a variation of two online games
	written for Atari ST BBS systems, Space Empire by Jon Radoff and
	Galactic Empire by Andromeda Software.  It is a multi-player game, the
	object of which is to rule more planets than any other player.  You can
	gain planets in two ways, (1) buying planets or (2) attacking other players
	and taking their planets.
	There is no "conclusion" to the game as such; the game continues until the
	sysop decides to reset the game.

Supported Platforms:
	Space Dynasty Elite has been tested on Redhat 7x-9x, and Mandrake 9.2 
	systems.  It has been tested with the linux version of Mystic BBS 1.07.3, 
	but is expected to work with other linux BBS packages.

	There are no plans at this time to create a Windows or DOS version of SDE 
	at this time, because there is already a DOS version of Space Dynasty.  If
	you want the DOS version, you can call my BBS at cyberia.darktech.org and
	download the file dynas306.zip.

Disclaimer:

	The Space Dynasty Elite Door is distributed without warranty.
	In no case shall I be held responsible for any damages or losses
	resulting from you running this software. By running this program
	you have agreed to take responsibility for any problems that may result.
	If you do not agree to this, don't run the program.

Installation:
	Installation is simple.  Copy the dynasty executable into your desired
	directory.  It requires no other files, but it will create data files
	on the fly.

	dynasty requires a single parameter.  This parameter is the full path
	and filename of your dropfile.

	dynasty can read the following drop file formats:

	door.sys
	chain.txt

	For a chain.txt dropfile the command line would look like this:
	# dynasty chain.txt
	or
	# dynasty /home/bbs/<node>/chain.txt

Editors:
	In the startup menu, there is an option that is not visible to any player 
	with a security level of less than 200.  It is the 'god menu'  This is where
	all the game editing is done.  I suggest that you run the game and set that
	up first.

Bug Reports:
	Space Dynasty Elite is a work in progress, and is as-such, unfinished.
	That being the case, bugs are sure to crop up.  I am interested in 
	finding out and squashing as many bugs as possible.  I also want to hear
	about any suggestions that will make game play more fun.

	If you have any questions, comments, or bug reports, please feel free
	to drop me a note.

	Sorry, I don't do IRC, or ICQ.

To Do:
	These are changes that I am intending to make to Space Dynasty Elite:

	- Add a messaging system
	- Interbbs play
