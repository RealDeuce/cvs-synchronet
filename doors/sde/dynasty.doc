Space Dynasty Elite,                 Version
by Darryl Perry                         1.1
--------------------------------------------

Space Dynasty Elite is an linux implementation of a WWIV BBS online game
called Space Dynasty.  Space Dynast was a variation of two online games 
written for Atari ST BBS systems, Space Empire by Jon Radoff and 
Galactic Empire by Andromeda Software.  It is a multi-player game, the 
object of which is to rule more planets than any other player.  You can 
gain planets in two ways, (1) buying planets or (2) attacking other players 
and taking their planets.
There is no "conclusion" to the game as such; the game continues until the
sysop decides to reset the game.

There are three types of planets you can choose to maintain:
  food planets - needed to grow food for your people or to sell to other
                 players
  army planets - for training troops to guard your dynasty/attack others
  ore planets  - mining for ore which brings you most of your money
Ore planets are recommended for new players particularly.


Starting the Game
-----------------
Each player has four turns each day in which to rule their empire.  There
are several daily phases, which will be described later.  Each turn proceeds
as follows:


(A) Maintenance
    You are notified of how much food was grown on your food planets,
soldiers trained on army planets, and money gained from ore mining and
taxes.
    You will then be prompted for the money needed for paying your army,
maintaining your planets, crime prevention, and feeding your army and
your people.  You need not pay all of it every turn, but there are
penalties for giving too little:
    - If you do not pay and feed your army they will not fight.  This is
      not a problem unless you are planning an attack.
    - If you pay your army less than half their salary they will revolt and
      cause a Civil War in your dynasty, causing you to lose part of your
      empire.  The same thing will happen if you don't feed your people or
      pay for planetary maintenance.
    - If you don't pay for crime prevention, costly acts of vandalism may
      occur.

The Food Market
    As well as your own food supply, there is a Galactic Common Market that
all players can buy food from or sell food to.  If the market is running
low on food, prices will be high, and if the market is overstocked, prices
will be low.  Here is your chance to make some money on the side, by buying
food when it is cheap and selling it at a higher price when it is needed.
Remember to keep enough to feed your own people/troops...


(B) Covert Operations
    This phase occurs only if you have covert agents available.  It allows
you the ability to attack someone covertly, without their knowledge...if
you can get away with it.  Covert Agents are used offensively and
defensively.  The more agents you have compared to the number of agents
your enemy has determines your chances of success; if you both have the
the same number, the odds are about 50-50.

When you hire covert agents, you can use them to do one of four things:

Covert Operations Menu
----------------------------
<1> Spy Mission........7,500
<2> Assassination.....10,000
<3> Sabotage..........12,500
<4> Insurgency.......100,000
<5> Plant a bomb...1,000,000
<0> Done
----------------------------

(1) A spy mission lets you see what defenses your enemy has, as well as his
insurgency level (see #4).
(2) Allows you to try to assassinate one of your enemy's generals.
(3) Allows you to try to sabotage one of your enemy's carriers.
(4) Insurgency is a measurement of the amount of internal rebellion your
enemy's government has to put up with.  For 100,000 credits, you can
try to fund this rebellion and encourage his overthrow.
    Your enemy must pay for putting down this rebellion, with the amount
dependent on the size of his empire.  The larger the empire, the more money
it takes.  Also, any level of insurgency will cause the loss of a number of
his offenses each turn.  The higher the insurgency, the more costly for him
in terms of money as well as soldiers and fighters.
(5) You may bomb an embassy or foodstores.  If successful, bombing an embassy
may kill as many as 300 enemy agents.  Bombing foodstores, if successful,
may destroy as many as 375,000 megatons of food.

If you are successful with your covert operation, your enemy will never
know who did it.  If not, your agent is executed, and the player receives
a message about your attempt.


(C) New Purchases
    After maintaining what you already have, you are given the following
menu to buy new supplies.

Item                        Cost        Owned
---------------------------------------------
<1> Soldier troops.........1,000..........100
<2> Fighter................1,500............0
<3> Defense Stations.......2,000............0
<4> Generals..............11,000............2
<5> Command ship..........60,000...........0%
<6> Colonize planet.......22,000............2
<7> Carriers..............15,000............1
<8> Covert Agents..........5,000............0
<9> Reconfigure planet...100,000..........N/A
<0> Done
---------------------------------------------
Your credits amount to 938,360.
Your choice? 

Experiment with purchases, but note the following:
    - You need 1 General for every 50 Troops.  If you buy/train a lot of
troops but have no Generals to lead them, all of them won't be able to go
into battle.
    - Defense Stations are the defensive equivalent of Fighters: If you
are attacking someone with a lot of defense stations, buy a lot of
fighters.  If you are expecting large fighter squadron attacks, buy a lot
of defense stations.
    - Carriers are needed to transport fighters for battle, 100 fighters
per carrier.  Carriers also allow you to send troops/money/food to the
other players.
    - A Command Ship will help your defensive capabilites.


(D) Battle
    Your chance to attack other players.  You are prompted for who you want
to attack and how many troops/fighters you want to send.


(E) Trade
    If you have any carriers you are allowed to use them to send food,
troops, or credits to anyone you feel like being nice to.


Score
-----
You receive 75 points per turn played, plus 20 points per planet owned.
25 points are deducted each time you attack, 50 points if the attack fails.


Daily Phases
------------
Several things happen at the beginning of your first turn and at the end
of your last turn each day.  You can ignore these until you get the hang
of the game, but here is an explanation when you are ready.

News - a list of all that has happened to you since you last played.

Subspace Radio Messages - short notes from other dynasties. These are
    received at the beginning of your turn, and you are allowed to send
    them at the end of your turn.

Daily Diplomatic Phase - a display of your relations with other dynasties.
There are four types of relations between two empires:
(1) Neutrality     - The default state. No support between the two players,
                     nor any declaration of hostilites.
(2) Minor Alliance - When you are under attack, 10% of your allies' troops
                     and defense stations automatically come to your aid.
(3) Major Alliance - When you are under attack, 20% of your allies' troops
                     and defense stations automatically come to your aid.
(4) Enemy          - Either you have openly attacked this player or he has
                     openly attacked you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's all I can think of, practice is really the best way to learn the
game.  I am currently working on adding new features so you will be
seeing updates.  The game is written in Turbo Pascal 5.5, and was largely
developed using PC Ditto, an IBM emulation program for the Atari ST.
