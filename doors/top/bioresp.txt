Biography Notes

Bio responses are stored in the file BIORESP.TOP.  This is simply a big record
of bio_resp_typ structs.

The response file is indexed through BIOIDX.TOP.  This is a record of 100 longs
per user, with each long containing the record number of the bio response for
the corresponding question.  For example, question 0's response will be pointed
to by the first long, question 1's by the second, etc.  This allows TOP to grab
all of a user's responses simply by seeking to that point in the index, loading
100 longs, then loading the responses directly, without excessive scanning.
