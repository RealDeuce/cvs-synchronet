How to upgrade from RAPLink 1.00 to TOPLink 2.00g1
--------------------------------------------------

    The upgrade procedure is fairly straightforward, but there are a few
mandatory steps you need to go through.

    1) Unpack TOPLink.  You can unpack it to a new directory, or to your
RAPLink directory.  If you unpack it to a new directory, be sure to copy the
DONTSHOW.TXT file from RAPLink to this directory after unpacking.

    2) Run TOPLINK /CONFIG and configure TOPLink.  You will have to reconfigure
ALL of the parameters, because both RAPLink and TOPLink store configuration
information in the executable (.EXE) file itself, and this information
unfortunately cannot be transfered between programs.

    3) TOPLink has some new settings.  The names and short descriptions
provided by TOPLink should be self-explanatory, but if you need additional
information then consult TOPLINK.DOC.

    4) If you use a batch file to run TOP, modify it to call TOPLINK.EXE
instead of RAPLINK.EXE.  With TOPLink, you _MUST_ specify a node number on the
command line!  This is different from RAPLink, with which a node number was
optional.

    5) Finally, change your TOP.CFG file so that CrashProtDelay is set to 0!
TOPLink will not work with CrashProtDelay turned on.

    Be sure to skim over TOPLINK.DOC and HISTORY.DOC for other new information!
