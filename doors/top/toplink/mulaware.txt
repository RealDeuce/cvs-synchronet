   FREEWARE AGREEMENT

     MulAware is a "freeware program" and is provided at no charge to
     the user.  Feel free to share it with your friends, but please do
     not give it away altered or as part of another system.  MulAware
     may NOT be used in a commercial environment without purchasing the
     source code from ABSoft.  A BBS operated for profit IS a commercial
     environment; however, a subscription system not operated for profit
     is not considered a commercial environment in relation to this
     agreement.

     Anyone distributing MulAware for any kind of remuneration must
     first contact ABSoft at the address below for authorization.  This
     authorization will be automatically granted to distributors
     recognized by the (ASP) as adhering to its guidelines for shareware
     distributors, and such distributors may begin offering MulAware
     immediately; however, ABSoft must still be advised so that the
     distributor can be kept up-to-date with the latest version of
     MulAware.

   WHAT IS MulAware?

     MulAware is a Turbo Pascal Unit to make your programs fully
     MultiTasker Aware.

     MulAware currently supports the following multitaskers:

     Windows 3.x & NT
     DESQview 2.xx
     DoubleDOS
     VMiX 2.xx
     MultiDos Plus 4.xx
     OS/2 2.0
     DOS 5.0 Task Switcher and Compatibles
     TaskView, TopView, OmniView, & Compatibles


   HOW TO USE MulAware

     If you are using TP 6.0, rename MULAWARE.TP6 to MULAWARE.TPU.  If
     you are using TP 7.0, rename MULAWARE.TP7 to MULAWARE.TPU.  Since
     this is a programmer's tool, I'm going to assume you have decent
     knowledge of computers in general, and Turbo Pascal in particular.
     Simply place MulAware in your USES statement.

     Uses
       Crt,
       MulAware,
       Dos;

     See the enclosed MULAWARE.INT for complete documentation on the
     Constants, Types, Variables, Functions, and Procedures in MulAware.

     The enclosed MULTEST.PAS is a sample program that tests for all
     the supported multitaskers, and returns an errorlevel based on
     what it finds.


   UNTESTED MULTITASKERS

     MulAware has not been tested under Windows NT, DoubleDOS, TaskView,
     TopView, and OmniView.  If you would like to donate a copy of any
     of these for testing, feel free to do so :)


   REGISTRATION

     MulAware is distributed as FreeWare.  This is a contribution to all
     the shareware/freeware/pd programmers, to whom I certainly owe a
     lot.  Please read the DISCLAIMER & FREEWARE AGREEMENT earlier in
     the documentation for more information.

     Source code is available from ABSoft.  Please see the enclosed
     registration form for information and pricing.
