  - In order for TOPLink to stay online it must update the data files before a
    certain time interval has passed.  Otherwise, TOP will think that TOPLink
    has crashed and remove it from the teleconference.  Thus, TOPLink has to
    know the CrashProtDelay setting from TOP.CFG.  However, you should actually
    set this a little lower (5-10 seconds lower) than the setting in TOP.CFG so
    that there is no danger of TOPLink taking too long if it is processing a
    lot of incoming or outgoing text.
