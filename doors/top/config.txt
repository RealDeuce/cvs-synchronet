Complete List of TOP Keywords
-----------------------------

Keywords can appear in the config. file in any order, unless noted.  All
keywords that do not appear will be assigned a default value, unless noted as
mandatory.  Default values should appear in the TOP source, obviously, and
should also appear in the docs and in the annotated config. file.  Commented
keywords aren't currently supported by the config. reader.  Keywords marked
with a ^ are not yet supported by the program itself.

Footnotes
---------

1 - One of "UNKNOWN", "RA2", "MAX2", "MAX3", or "SBBS11".

2 - The letters A through Z represent supported bps rates if present.
    A=300,B=600,C=1200,D=2400,E=4800,F=7200,G=9600,H=12000,I=14400,J=16800,
    K=19200,L=21600,M=24000,N=26400,O=28800,P=31200,Q=33600.  The remaining
    letters are unused at this time.  The symbol * can also be used.  It
    represents a customized bps rate, and should be followed immediately by a
    bps rate, for example: "*38400".  There can be as many * symbols as needed.
    Letters can be seperated by spaces if needed, but this should normally not
    be done.

3 - UseHandles keyword obsoleted by AllowHandles and AllowNewHandles.

4 - Can contain the words "None", "Local", "Remote", or "LAN", each signifying
    the type of session the setting is allowed to be used with.  If "None" is
    present, it overrides the entire line, meaning the setting will not be used
    whatsoever, even if other valid words are present.

5 - Format is "<day|type> [<time>]".  Using a day means that maintenance will
    be performed on a weekly basis on the specified day.  Days can be one of
    "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", or
    "Saturday", though only the first three letters are needed.  Using a type
    means maintenance will be performed as described by the type used.  Types
    can be one of "Daily", or "Weekly", with "Weekly" being the same as
    specifying "Sunday" as a day.  Time is optional, and indicates the time (in
    HH[:MM[:SS]] format.  If a time is omitted, 00:00:00 will be used.

6 - Can contain any ASCII character including space.  Therefore, chars. should
    logically not be separated by spaces.  Space can NOT be the first character
    used, for obvious reasons.
