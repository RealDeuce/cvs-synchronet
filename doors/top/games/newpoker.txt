New Poker Commands & Notes
--------------------------

Commands with a * instead of a hyphen are for the future, and not needed for
the first beta.  Anything with a û (251) after it means it's been completed
_IN_FULL_, except for text displays and text message sends.

Main Commands

JOIN <num> - Join game number <num>.  Maybe allow ALL here, I dunno.           û
QUIT <num> - Quit game number <num>.  ALL is allowed to quit all games.        û
MAIN <num> - Sets the main poker game to <num>.  OFF sets no main game.        û

Logic

The base is still the file POKERDAT.TOP, only the format is different.  All    û
nodes access this file for their own needs.

As before, messages are still sent, though they are a lot different than       û
before, and there are only two of them now.  The new messages are below.  AIG =
All In Game.

GameOver   - "Game over!".  Sent to AIG by last better.  Starts postproc.      û
Finished   - "Postproc Finished".  To AIG by last to write.  Starts handdisp.  û

Everything else is done by the node where the command was issuedû.  Misc.
commands can't happen during a game so they don't need messages, and
notifications are sent via MSG_GENERIC normal messagesû.  Hand and pot commands
are handled as nowû.  Turn changes are written to the file and turns are
performed by the same node, so there is no need for turn change messagesû.

When a game starts or cards are discarded, the new hand is immediately "dealt"
by the nodeû.  The message are sent _AFTER_ dealing, and the file remains
locked during dealing to prevent deck problemsû.

Bets and discards are processed, the pot is recalculated and the cards shuffled
if needed, then the message is sent to the next callerû.  Notifications are
sent via normal MSG_GENERICû.

Folds are rather unimportant.  If it's the user's turn right now then a
Yourwhatever message is sent after the folding process is cleaned upû.  A
MSG_GENERIC visual notification is sent, but that's allû.

Post processing is like this:  Each node evaluates the hands, pays out if      û
needed, and writes a check value of the results.

Handdisp is like this:  The hand is displayed, obviously.  First, however, the û
checksums are all compared, and if there's a difference, the original cybercash
totals before ante (stored in the data file) are restored and a problem is
reported.  The game is also shut down and deleted at this point in the hope
that the problem isn't severe and a restart will correct it.

Background processing occurs on an adustable time interval (1s is the lowest
since a time() comparison is done) and checks whether sufficient time has
elapsed from the last action to take action now.  "Game initializations"û and
"player turns" are the actions that are checked up on.  The causes are DELAY
time reachedû and wait time reached, resp. The actions are to start the gameû
or delete the player, resp.

Wait time warnings occur at 1/2, 2/3, 5/6, 11/12, and 23/24 of waittime (the
set values from the old poker), with punting occuring at 1/1 of course.  These
times cut it a little close together if waittime is small, but since that means
an intense, fast-paced game, that should be okay.  A check to only use the
highest most recent value should be put in, so if two times round up to the
same number, or if more than one second passes between checks, then the thing
won't blare unncessarily at the user.

An array tracks the locking and unlocking that the node has done on each game, û
and the TOP-exit cleanup uses this array in case anything goes wrong during a
poker command.
