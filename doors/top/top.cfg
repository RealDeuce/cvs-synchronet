; Configuration File for The Online Pub v2.00g2
; ---------------------------------------------
;
;     All settings in this file are fully documented with comments, so you
; should not have any problems editing this file to suit your needs.  If,
; however, you do not understand what a setting is used for, leave it alone
; and contact the author before changing it.  This file is quite large, but
; there are actually only about fourty settings, and most of those do not
; have to be changed.  Those who are experienced with ASCII configuration files
; (especially Maximus users) like this one should have no trouble with this
; file.  A configuration editor will be released with a future version of TOP.
;
;     The format of each line of the configuration file is one of the
; following:
;
;     ;<comment>
;     <keyword> <setting>
;
;     The first example is a comment line, such as the lines you are reading
; now.  These lines are ignored by TOP.  The second example is an actual
; configuration setting, and many examples of them are found in the remainder
; of this file.  Note that you may seperate <keyword> and <setting> with extra
; spaces for readability, if you wish.  All keywords and settings are
; case-insensitive, except where noted.
;
;     NOTE:  Many settings refer to a "default setting".  The default setting
; is the one used in the configuration file that is provided with TOP.  The
; default setting will _NOT_ be used in place of a missing setting!  Be sure
; all keywords and settings appear in this file and are spelled correctly.  If
; you are having problems with your configuration file, refer to the one
; included in the TOP archive.
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;     The first section of keywords is used to give TOP various information
; about your system and environment.
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * BBSType *
;
;     Tells TOP what type of BBS you are running.  Valid settings are:
;
;     "UNKNOWN", "RA2", "MAX2", "MAX3", "SBBS11"
;
;     UNKNOWN - Unsupported BBS type.
;     RA2 - RemoteAccess 2.00g1, 2.00, 2.01, 2.02, 2.50g1, and 2.50.
;     MAX2 - Maximus 2.00, 2.01, 2.02.
;     MAX3 - Maximus 3.00, 3.01.
;     SBBS11 - SuperBBS 1.17 (and possibly older versions).
;
;     DO NOT INCLUDE THE QUOTATION MARKS!  If you are not running any of the
; above listed BBS types, set this to UNKNOWN.  TOP will still work as usual,
; but users will not be able to see who is on the BBS, nor page these users.
;
BBSType UNKNOWN
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * SysopName *
;
;     Tells TOP the name of the System Operator or LAN Supervisor.  You may use
; any printable ASCII character, but may not exceed 40 characters.  If you
; exceed 40 characters, the name will be truncated at 40.
;
SysopName Paul Sidorsky
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * BBSName *
;
;     Tells TOP the name of your BBS.  You may use any printable ASCII
; character, but may not exceed 40 characters.  If you exceed 40 characters,
; the name will be truncated at 40.
;
BBSName ISMWare Support
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;     The next group of settings tell TOP where to find and create various
; files on your system.
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * TOPPath *
;
;     This should be set to the directory where TOP is located.  It will be
; used by TOP to both find and create imporant files.  The trailing backslash
; is optional, but recommended.
;
TOPPath /usr/bbs/sbbs/doors/top/
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * TOPWorkPath *
;
;     This directory is used by TOP for its inter-node communications during
; chat.  As it is used heavily, setting this to a RAMDisk is _HIGHLY_
; recommended.  The trailing backslash is optional, but recommended.
;
TOPWorkPath /usr/bbs/sbbs/doors/top/temp/
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * TOPANSIPath *
;
;     This setting tells TOP where to locate its various ANSI, AVATAR, and
; RIP files.  These files are used for things like help screens, so this
; setting should be correct.  The trailing backslash is optional, but
; recommended.  You can use the file MOVEANS.BAT to transfer all of TOP's
; external files to this directory after you create it.
;
TOPANSIPath /usr/bbs/sbbs/doors/top/ansi/
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * BBSPath *
;
;     This setting tells TOP where your BBS files are located.  While this
; setting may not be used by TOP in all configurations, it is important that
; it be set correctly to avoid future problems later on.  It _IS_ used with
; RemoteAccess and SuperBBS setups.  It is _NOT_ used if you set BBSType to
; Unknown.  The trailing backslash is optional, but recommended.  See TOP.DOC
; for more information on setting this path.
;
BBSPath /usr/bbs/sbbs/
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * BBSIPCPath *
;
;     Tells TOP where to find your BBS's InterProcess Communications files.
; This is sometimes also called the Semaphore Path or Temporary Path.  If you
; intend to allow your users to communicate with users outside of TOP, this
; MUST be correct.  It may be ignored if you have set BBSType to Unknown.  The
; trailing backslash is optional, but recommended.  See TOP.DOC for more
; information about setting this path.
;
BBSIPCPath /usr/bbs/sbbs/data/temp/
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * TOPActionPath *
;
;     This setting tells TOP where to locate all of the compiled TOP Action
; files (.TAC files).  If you have a lot of action files, you may want to put
; them all in their own subdirectory to avoid cluttering your TOP directory.
; Normally, however, you can just set this to your TOP directory.  The trailing
; backslash is optional, but recommended.
;
TOPActionPath /usr/bbs/sbbs/doors/top/
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;     The settings in this next section are called Options, and they toggle
; various features of TOP on or off.  You may use any one of the following
; words as valid settings.  The words on the first line turn the option ON, and
; the words on the second line turn the option OFF.
;
;      ON  YES    ENABLED   1    TRUE
;     OFF   NO   DISABLED   0   FALSE
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * ShowTitle *
;
;     TOP has the ability to display a Title Page (named TOPTITLE.ANS) to your
; users upon startup.  If you wish to enable this feature, turn this option ON.
; If you do not wish a Title Page to be displayed, turn this option OFF.
;
ShowTitle No
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * ShowNews *
;
;     TOP is able to display a News Bulletin (named TOPNEWS.ANS) to your users
; once they have logged in.  This is useful if you have recently upgraded to a
; new version of TOP and there have been new User Settings added.  You can use
; this bulletin to tell the users about these options, and where to change
; them.  If you wish a News Bulletin to be displayed, turn this option ON.  If
; you don't want to use this feature, turn this option OFF.
;
ShowNews No
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * AllowActions *
;
;     This option allows you to turn off Actions and all Action-related
; commands.  If you do not want to use TOP's Action features, turn this option
; OFF.  Otherwise, leave this setting ON.
;
;     NOTE:  This option does _NOT_ turn off General Actions.  Use the
; AllowGAs option for that purpose.
;
AllowActions Yes
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * AllowGAs *
;
;     This option controls whether or not General Actions (GAs) are allowed.
; To allow the GA and GA'S commands to be used, turn this setting ON.  If you
; do not wish General Actions to be used, turn this setting OFF.
;
AllowGAs Yes
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * AllowNewHandles *
;
;     This option tells TOP whether or not to ask the user for a new handle
; when they first enter TOP.  If this option is ON, TOP will prompt new users
; for a handle.  If this option is OFF, TOP will use the real name or handle
; provided by the BBS, as determined by the AllowHandles setting.  Note that if
; you turn this setting OFF, but turn the AllowChangeHandles option ON, then
; this setting will virtually have no effect.
;
AllowNewHandles No
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * AllowHandles *
;
;     This option tells TOP whether or not it should use the user's handle or
; real name if AllowNewHandles is turned OFF.  If this setting is turned ON,
; TOP will use the user's handle during chat.  If this setting is OFF, TOP will
; use the user's real name.  If AllowNewHandles is turned ON, then this setting
; has no effect.
;
AllowHandles Yes
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * AllowChangeHandle *
;
;     This option controls whether or not the user can change his or her handle
; inside TOP.  If it is set to ON, handle changes will be permitted.  If it is
; set to OFF, the user will not be able to change his or her handle.
; Obviously, if AllowHandles or AllowNewHandles is set to OFF, this option
; should be too, or the other settings will have no effect.  NOTE:  Changing
; handles in TOP does NOT affect the user's handle on the BBS.
;
AllowChangeHandle Yes
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * AllowChangeSex *
;
;     This option lets you control whether or not the user may change his or
; her gender.  If you wish "instantaneous sex changes" to be performed inside
; TOP, turn this option ON.  Otherwise, turn it OFF.  This option may sound
; silly, but often several users will be at one person's house and if they are
; of different genders, this option (along with the AllowChangeHandles) option
; will allow the people at such gatherings to properly identify themselves.
; NOTE:  Changing genders inside TOP does NOT affect the user's gender on the
; BBS.
;
AllowChangeSex Yes
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * AllowChangeEXMsg *
;
;     This option allows you to control whether or not your users can set
; custom messages to be displayed to others when they enter or exit TOP.
; Turning this option ON allows these messages, while turning it OFF will force
; TOP to always use the default entry and exit messages (which can be defined
; in the language file).
;
AllowChangeEXMsg Yes
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * AllowPrivateMsgs *
;
;     This option controls whether or not users can send private messages.
; These messages include whispers, secret actions, and pages to users elsewhere
; on the BBS.  Turn this setting ON to allow these messages.  In the rare case
; that you do not want users to be able to send private messages, turn this
; setting OFF.
;
AllowPrivateMsgs Yes
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * AllowForgetting *
;
;     This option tells TOP whether or not to allow users to forget other
; users.  When a user forgets another user, they will not be able to see any
; message from that user.  This is handy for dealing with problem users.  If
; you wish to allow users to forget other users, turn this setting ON.  If you
; do not wish users to be able to forget other users, turn this setting OFF.
;
AllowForgetting Yes
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * UseHandles *
;
;     This option tells TOP whether it should use the user's Real Name or
; Handle in displays that have both available, such as a NODES listing and
; pages outside of TOP.  If you want to use the user's Handle, turn this
; option ON.  If you would rather use Real Names instead, turn it OFF.  NOTE:
; Your BBS software and drop file type must be able to provide TOP with both a
; real name and a handle, otherwise this setting has no effect.
;
UseHandles Yes
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * ShowOpeningCredits *
;
;     This setting controls whether or not TOP will display the opening
; "credits" when a user enters TOP.  The opening credits show the name of the
; program, the author, and some other information about TOP.  If you wish this
; information to be shown in full, turn this setting ON.  If you wish this
; information not to be shown, providing a more "seamless" look, turn this
; setting OFF.
;
;     NOTE:  Even with this setting OFF, TOP will still show a one-line
; identification header.  It will show the name, version, and copyright
; information.  This information is vital to the protection of both you and the
; author of TOP, and must be shown no matter what.
;
ShowOpeningCredits Yes
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * ShowClosingCredits *
;
;     This setting tells TOP whether or not to display closing "credits" when a
; user exits TOP.  The closing credits feature a program identification and a
; message to the user that they are returning to the BBS.  To have this
; information shown to the user, leave this setting ON.  To show nothing to the
; user upon leaving TOP, turn this setting OFF.  When this setting is turned
; OFF, nothing else will be displayed, unlike the ShowOpeningCredits setting.
;
ShowClosingCredits Yes
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * AllowHighASCII *
;
;     When this setting is ON, TOP will permit high ASCII characters (128 to
; 254) to be entered by users.  If it is OFF, only the standard ASCII set of
; characters (32 to 127) will be allowed.  NOTE:  This setting does _NOT_
; affect the displaying of any high ASCII characters in the language file!
;
AllowHighASCII Yes
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;     The next group of settings are General TOP Settings.  They tell TOP how
; you want it to function.  Most of them are numerical values, but there are
; some exceptions, which are noted.
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * MaxMsgLen *
;
;     This setting tells TOP the maximum amount of characters a user may type
; before being forced to press ENTER to send their text.  The lowest value
; permitted is 0, though this is rather foolish because users won't be able to
; type anything.  The realistic minimum is 20, which should give users enough
; room to use all of the commands in TOP.  The recommended value is 255.  This
; is also the maximum value.
;
MaxMsgLen 255
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * InactiveTimeout *
;
;     This setting tells TOP how long, in seconds, to wait before ejecting
; users from TOP if they have not typed anything or issued any commands.
; Acceptable values are from 0 to 32767.  Setting this to 0 will disable the
; Inactivity Timeout completely.  The recommended value is 300, which allows
; five minutes of inactivity before ejecting the user.  NOTE:  Users who are in
; chat may want to do things like check information on files or go to the
; bathroom, thus you may want to set this higher than you would for door games
; or the BBS itself.
;
InactiveTimeout 300
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * UseCredits *
;
;     TOP is capable of using RemoteAccess 2.xx's user credit system to limit
; the time spent in TOP.  To enable credit usage, set this to the amount of
; credits that you wish to deduct per minute.  TOP will exit when this number
; reaches 0.  TOP will also show the amount of credits the user has remaining
; when the user does a TIME command.  Valid settings are 0 which disables RA
; credit usage, a positive number which will cause TOP to monitor credit
; usage but _NOT_ subtract the credits on exit (assuming RA will do so when
; it returns), and a negative number, which will cause TOP to monitor credit
; usage and deduct them on exit.  Negative numbers can be from -65535 to -1,
; and positive numbers from 1 to 65535.
;
;     NOTE:  TOP's credit support is not as sophisticated as RA's.  You can not
; deduct fractions of a credit as you can with RA, and you can only have one
; UseCredits setting for all users as opposed to one setting for each security
; level.  For this reason, you should set this value the same as the setting
; for the most common security level that your BBS uses.  If you use fractional
; credit deduction in RA, round this value up to the nearest credit (or down if
; you're feeling generous).  This way TOP will at least be able to approximate
; when to kick a user out of TOP and back to the BBS.  It is recommended you
; test to see if RA deducts the credits itself upon return from TOP.  If so,
; use a positive number.  Otherwise, use a negative number so TOP will
; deduct the credits itself.  This may depend on the RA version and/or
; settings you are using.
;
;     IMPORTANT:  RA credit usage requires EXITINFO.BBS to be used as the drop
; file.  Also, if you are using a negative number, RA must be able to
; reread the changed EXITINFO.BBS file when TOP exits.
;
UseCredits 0
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * LocalBeeping *
;
;     This setting controls which type of nodes TOP will sound beeps for on the
; local console. Valid settings for this keyword consist of one or more of the
; following words:
;
;     "None", "Remote", "Local", "LAN", or "All"
;
;     None - Never sound beeps on the local console.
;     Remote - Sound beeps for Remote type nodes.
;     Local - Sound beeps for Local type nodes, or when a local user is logged
;             on to a node of Remote type.
;     LAN - Sound beeps for LAN type nodes.
;     All - Always sound beeps on the local console.
;
;     As with other settings of this type, do not include the quotation marks!
; The recommended setting for this keyword is "Local LAN", which will only
; sound beeps when there is somebody at the local console inside TOP who needs
; to hear them.  The "None" and "All" settings should not be used with any of
; the other settings.
;
LocalBeeping Local LAN
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * LangFile *
;
;     This setting tells TOP the base file name of the Language File to use for
; TOP.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO _NOT_ SPECIFY A PATH OR EXTENSION!  TOP
; will append the .LNG extension automatically, and look for this file in the
; TOP Path as set above.
;
LangFile pub
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * DefaultChannel *
;
;     This setting specifies which channel TOP will place users in when they
; enter TOP.  Valid settings are 1 to 3999999999.  Conference names cannot be
; used here in this version of TOP.
;
DefaultChannel 1
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * MaxNodes *
;
;     Specifies the maximum number of nodes you have on your system.  It's
; recommended you set this value a little higher than the actual total number
; of nodes so you have a bit of breathing space.  Acceptable values are from 1
; to 32767.  WARNING - The higher you set this value, the more memory TOP will
; need!
;
;     VERY IMPORTANT:  This setting specifies the maximum NUMBER of nodes, not
; the HIGHEST node!  Because node numbers in TOP start at 0, setting this
; setting to a value of 10 would enable nodes 0 through 9 only, and NOT node
; 10!  Some systems use node 0 as a local-only node, and future versions of TOP
; will support this convention, hence the need for this setting to include
; node 0.  This version does _NOT_ support node 0, however, and will default
; to use node 1 if 0 is passed on the command line as the node number.  In
; short, always set this setting no lower than your highest node number PLUS
; ONE.
;
MaxNodes 10
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * MaxPWTries *
;
;     This setting controls how many failed attempts at entering a password TOP
; will allow before returning the user to the BBS.  The default setting is 3.
; Valid settings are from 1 to 256.
;
MaxPWTries 3
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * ActionFiles *
;
;     This setting specifies the compiled TOP Action Files (.TAC files) that
; TOP will load and use.  All of the names should be listed on the same line
; following this keyword, seperated by spaces and _WITHOUT_ the .TAC extension
; (VERY IMPORTANT!!!).  TOP will add the extension itself and look for these
; files in the directory specified by the TOPActionPath keyword.  You can have
; up to 32767 different files, however the string following this keyword may
; only be at most 256 characters in length.
;
ActionFiles main sysop
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * MaxChannelDefs *
;
;     This setting specifies the maximum number of channel definitions that
; TOP can expect.  You should check this number against the number of
; definitions in CHANNELS.CFG each time you update CHANNELS.CFG.  SETTING THIS
; TOO LOW WILL CAUSE MAJOR PROBLEMS!  The recommended setting is 50, which
; should allow for plenty of channel and conference definitions without taking
; up very much memory.  Acceptable values are from 0 to 2 147 483 648, but you
; need memory to hold all them!  Each channel definition takes up roughly 128
; bytes.
;
MaxChannelDefs 50
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;     This group of settings tells TOP the minimum security level that a user
; must have in order to use certain features of TOP.
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * SecuritySysop *
;
;     This setting tells TOP the security level of people that you wish to have
; Sysop access inside TOP.  IT IS VITAL THAT THIS SETTING BE CORRECT, OR YOU
; MAY ALLOW YOUR USERS TO DO DAMAGING THINGS TO YOUR SYSTEM!  Accepted values
; are 0 - 65535.
;
;     IMPORTANT:  Users who meet this security level have access to SYSOP
; commands, have moderator powers in ALL channels, and cannot be forgotten by
; other users!
;
SecuritySysop 65535
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * SecurityNewUser *
;
;     This setting determines which security level TOP assigns to a user who
; first enters TOP.  If set to a value above 0, TOP will give _all_ users,
; including yourself, this security when they first enter TOP.  It will be up
; to you to upgrade or downgrade users inside TOP (using the SYSOP SETSEC)
; command.  You will also have to upgrade yourself manually by running TOP
; with the EDIT parameter.  Valid settings are from 0, which uses the
; security obtained from the BBS drop file, to 65535.
;
SecurityNewUser 0
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * SecurityTalk *
;
;    This setting tells TOP what security level is required for a user to send
; any text in TOP.  If a user does not have this security level, they will only
; be able to read the conversation (or send actions or whispers if they meet
; those security levels).  Valid settings are from 0 to 65535.
;
SecurityTalk 25
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * SecurityChangeHandle *
;
;     This setting specifies the security a user requires in order to change
; his or her handle.  It has no effect if the AllowChangeHandles option is
; turned OFF.  Valid settings are from 0 to 65535.
;
SecurityChangeHandle 0
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * SecurityChangeSex *
;
;     This setting controls the security required in order for a user to be
; able to change their sex (gender).  It has no effect when the AllowChangeSex
; keyword is turned OFF.  Valid settings are from 0 to 65535.
;
SecurityChangeSex 0
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * SecurityChangeEXMsg *
;
;     This setting tells TOP the security a user needs to be able to change
; their entry and exit messages.  Entry and exit messages are customized
; messages that can be displayed by TOP when a user enters and exits TOP.
; Valid settings are from 0 to 65535.
;
SecurityChangeEXMsg 0
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * SecuritySendPrivate *
;
;     This setting tells TOP what security is required to send private messages
; (whispers, secret actions, and BBS pages).  Valid settings are from 0 to
; 65535.
;
SecuritySendPrivate 0
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * SecurityActionUse *
;
;     This setting tells TOP the security required to use actions.  It will
; _not_ prevent these users from seeing actions, just using them.  Valid
; settings are from 0 to 65535.
;
SecurityActionUse 0
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * SecurityForget *
;
;     This setting specifies the security required to forget and remember other
; users.  Valid settings are from 0 to 65535.
;
SecurityForget 0
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;     The next group of settings are used to tune TOP's performance.
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * PollDelay *
;
;     Specifies the delay, in tenths of a second, between "polls" (checks) of
; the incoming message queue.  Valid settings are from 0 to 65535.  If TOP
; slows down your system too much, raising this setting may help.  If you don't
; experience any slowness while running TOP, you can try lowering this setting.
; A setting of 0 is NOT recommended, as it will cause rather ballistic polling
; and almost certainly slow down your system.  A value of 1, however, should be
; alright if you're using a RAMDisk.
;
PollDelay 5
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * RetryDelay *
;
;     This setting specifies the amount of time, in tenths of a second, between
; retries of a failed file i/o operation.  The default setting of 5 should be
; fine, but if you have a slow hard drive or computer you may want to raise
; this value to take some stress off of your system should a file i/o operation
; ever fail.  Acceptable values are from 0 to 65535.
;
RetryDelay 5
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * RetryMax *
;
;     Specifies the maximum number of times to retry a file i/o operation
; before reporting failure.  Acceptable values are from 0 to 65535.
; Multiplying this value with the value for RetryDelay will give you the total
; amount of time it takes for TOP to report a failure.  It's recommended you
; adjust this value so that when multiplied with RetryDelay it will yield about
; 50, which is 5 seconds.
;
RetryMax 10
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * CrashProtDelay *
;
;     TOP's Crash Protection ensures that any node listed as being active
; really IS active.  It does this by having each node update the NODEIDX.TCH
; file every so often.  This setting determines the maximum allowable time, in
; seconds, between each update.  Valid settings are from 10 to 65535, or 0 to
; disable crash protection.
;
;     If you're running a RAMDisk, start this value off around 30 and test TOP
; with several users at once.  If users "vanish" for no reason, bump this up in
; 30 second increments until you find the value where this does not happen.  If
; you don't run a RAMDisk, start this off at 180 and do likewise.  Generally,
; values between 180 and 300 (3-5 minutes) should be reliable on all systems
; while still allowing crashed nodes to be removed within a reasonable amount
; of time.  If TOP still removes nodes falsely, try using a very high value
; like 900 or 1200 (15 or 20 minutes).  This will diminish the effectiveness of
; crash protection somewhat, but will at least allow TOP to remove crashed
; nodes without human intervention.  If TOP _still_ creates "vanishing" nodes
; even at rediculously high values, set this to 0 and contact the author.
; Crash protection is a very difficult feature for the author to test and
; effectiveness will vary greatly between systems.

; * PrivChatBufSize *
;
;     This setting controls the internal private chat transmit buffer size.
; When this buffer is full, TOP will automatically flush the private chat
; buffer, causing the text typed by a user to be sent to the other user.  This
; buffer is normally dumped after each character typed, but if a write fails it
; will start to fill up.  The default setting of 1024 is high, but it is best
; to err on the side of caution.  Valid settings are from 1 to 65535.

;
; * PrivChatMaxTries *
;
;     This setting tells TOP how many times to retry a failed file operation
; during private chats.  It should be sufficiently high to account for system
; lag or natural file I/O delays.  An extremely high amount of I/O takes place
; during a private chat (even more than during regular chat), so a value around
; 100 (the default) is recommended.  Valid settings are from 1 to 65535.

;
; * MaxCensorWarnHigh *
;
;     This setting tells TOP how many highly offensive words a user may
; attempt to say before being disconnected.  Highly offensive words are those
; with severity levels 1 through 3.  Once the user is over the warn limit,
; any word assigned severity level 2 will immediately disconnect the user who
; says the word.  High- and low-grade offensive words each have their own
; warn counter.  Valid settings are from 0 to 65535.  A setting of 0 means
; that the consequences for these levels are ALWAYS enforced, effectively
; making levels 2 and 1 the same.  For further details on setting up TOP's
; censor, see CENSOR.CFG.

MaxCensorWarnHigh 3
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * MaxCensorWarnLow *
;
;     This setting tells TOP how many low-grade offensive words a user may
; say before the user is disconnected.  Low-grade offensive words are those
; with severity levels 4 and 5.  Once the user is over the warn limit, any
; word assigned severity level 4 will immediately disconnect the user who
; says the word.  High- and low-grade offensive words each have their own
; warn counter.  Valid settings are from 0 to 65535.  A setting of 0 means
; that the consequences for these levels are ALWAYS enforced, effectively
; making levels 4 and 1 the same.  For further details on setting up TOP's
; censor, see CENSOR.CFG.

; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; * CensorTimerHigh *
;
;     This setting determines how long TOP will preserve the warning count
; for highly offensive words.  Once the specified number of seconds has
; elapsed without a highly offensive word being typed by a user, TOP will
; decrease the number of high-level warnings for that user (if any have
; accumulated) by one.  This setting allows TOP to "see" that a problem user
; has "cooled off" and act more tolerant.  This timer is not affected by
; low-grade offensive words.  Valid settings are from 0 to 65535.  A setting
; of 0 means that TOP will NEVER forget a user's past highly offensive
; language unless he or she reenters TOP.  Please see CENSOR.CFG for further
; details on how to use this setting.

;
; * CensorTimerLow *
;
;     This setting determines how long TOP will preserve the warning count
; for low-grade offensive words.  Once the specified number of seconds has
; elapsed without a low-grade offensive word being typed by a user, TOP will
; decrease the number of low-level warnings for that user (if any have
; accumulated) by one.  This setting allows TOP to "see" when topics that are
; considered inappropriate have passed, and act more tolerant towards users
; that might have participated in the discussion.  This timer is not affected
; by highly offensive words.  Valid settings are from 0 to 65535.  A setting
; of 0 means that TOP will NEVER forget a user's past low-grade offensive
; language unless he or she reenters TOP.  Please see CENSOR.CFG for further
; details on how to use this setting.

;
; * DefaultPrefs *
;
;     This setting lets you set the default personal preference options for
; new users.  This is useful if you have just switched from a different
; conferencing program and want TOP to behave more like that program by
; default, to ease the transition for your users.  It is also useful if you
; have changed the language file and want TOP to behave in a manner suited to
; that language file by default.  For example, some language files may be more
; suited to Dual Window chat mode, thus it may be desirable to have TOP default
; to Dual Window chat mode for new users.
;
;     This setting is actually a combination of 12 different option-style
; settings.  Each option is turned ON by default by using a Y or a 1.  Use
; the letter N or a 0 to turn the option OFF by default.
;
;     The 12 different options are listed below.  The letter for each
; option is the same as that option's letter in the profile editor (unless
; you have changed them via the language file).  A template is provided above
; the actual keyword so you can easily change one or all of the settings.  The
; recommended settings (which are those that previous versions of TOP and RAP
; had fixed as defaults) for each option are listed in parentheses.

;
; * ActionPrefix *
;
;     This setting allows you to specify one or more characters that must be
; placed in front of an action command.  This helps prevent "accidental
; actions", which occur when a user starts a sentence with an action verb but
; doesn't intend to send an action.  It also helps distinguish actions from
; other TOP commands.
;
;     You may specify up to 10 characters as a prefix, though it is recommended
; that you just use one.  Be sure not to use a character or characters that
; might be used in other TOP commands (such as /).  The recommended prefix is a
; single period character.  This means that action commands will look like
; ".slap joe" and ".yell WAKE UP!".  You may also specify "NONE", which tells
; TOP that no prefix is required to send an action (i.e. the user only needs to
; type the action verb to use an action).  This is how TOP has treated action
; commands in the past.  NOTE:  This setting also affects personal actions.
;
ActionPrefix NONE

; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; * ForceBio *
;
;     This setting lets you force users to fill out their biography before they
; are allowed to chat.  This setting will most likely be used for systems where
; meeting people is the sole objective.  It is also useful if you have been
; running a previous version of TOP or RAP and want your users to use the new
; biography feature.  To force people to fill out their biographies, turn this
; setting ON.  Otherwise, leave this setting OFF.
;
;     When this setting is ON, _ANY_ user that has not filled out _all_ of the
; biography questions will be forced to do so before they may chat!  This
; includes users who already have chatted in TOP.  If users try to skip a
; question or hang up and call back, they will still be forced to fill out the
; remainder of their biography next time they log on.  Note that this setting
; obviously can't prevent users from entering garbage or "none" for every
; question, but remember that a poorly filled out biography usually tells other
; users more about a person than a properly filled out biography does!
;
;     NOTE:  If you turn this setting ON, you should not configure any
; biography string responses with a minimum string length of 0.  Otherwise,
; when TOP is forcing the user to fill out his or her biography, TOP will let
; the user press ENTER to skip the question, however, after the remaining
; questions have been completed, TOP will see that this question has not been
; filled out and ask for the user's response again.  This can be confusing to a
; user.
