*** WARNING: Do not PKLITE, LZEXE or do any similar thing to the BJ4TOP.  Doing
             so will corrupt the program!  BJ4TOP writes its configuration
             directly to the BJ4TOP.EXE files.

It is recommended you put these files in a seperate directory from TOP.

                               [ Running BJ4TOP ]

First of all, make sure TOP HAS BEEN RUN PREVIOUSLY OR IS RUNNING.  BJ4TOP will
not initialize/create the NODEIDX.TCH and NODEIDX2.TCH files.  Then, run BJ4TOP
with these parameters:
============================================================================
BJ4TOP <work path> <node>

<work path>  Is the path to TOP's work directory.
<node>       Is the node BJ4TOP should use.
============================================================================
Examples would be:
Command line>BJ4TOP C:\TOP\WORKDIR 4

In any TOP sessions that are running, you should see this:
==========================================================
Blackjack Dealer just sauntered into the Pub!
*** Blackjack v2.00 Game Module Active ***
Type /BJ HELP for the commands.
=================================================

If you enter "/BJ HELP" in a TOP session, you will get this command list for
blackjack:
=================================================
Enter /BJ BET <amount> to change your bet (cannot be done during a game).
Enter /BJ CD or /BJ $ for your current number of Cyberdollars.
Enter /BJ DOUBLE 2 to double down on your second hand.
Enter /BJ DOUBLE to double down.
Enter /BJ HAND to view the dealer's and your own cards.
Enter /BJ HELP for this commands list.
Enter /BJ HIT to be dealt a card.
Enter /BJ HIT 2 to be dealt a card to your second hand.
Enter /BJ INSURE to make an insurance bet against a blackjack.
Enter /BJ OFF to be dealt out of blackjack.
Enter /BJ ON to join in the next game of blackjack.
Enter /BJ SCAN to see who's playing blackjack.
Enter /BJ SPLIT to split your hand.
Enter /BJ STAY to end your turn.
Enter /BJ TURN to see who's turn it is.
=================================================

So, if a user wanted to play a game s/he would type in "/BJ ON".
