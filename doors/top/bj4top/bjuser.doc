Game Play
---------
    The object of the game is to draw cards that add up to 21 or as close
to 21 as possible without going over (Bust).  Blackjack is an Ace and Ten
value card on the first two cards dealt.  Blackjack pays 3 to 2.
    The Jack, Queen, and King count 10.  The Aces counts 1 or 11, whichever
you wish.  All other cards count as face value.  The dealer gives each
player two cards.  The dealer's first card is face up, his second card is
face down.
    If you are satisfied with the total of your two cards, you can "stand"
(draw no more cards).  If not, you can take a "hit" (draw one or more cards,
one at a time).  If your total is nearer 21 than the Dealer's, you win even
money.
    If you go over 21 (Bust) you lose even if the Dealer goes Bust.  A tie is
a Standoff and nobody loses.  After each player is satisfied with the cards
s/he has asked for, the Dealer turns up his hidden card.  If he has 16 or
less he must draw additional cards until he reaches 17 or over.  If he has 17
or more he does not take any more cards.  If he Busts he must pay all the
players still in the game.

Pairs
-----
    Always split pairs of Aces and pairs of Eights.  Another equal amount of
bet is wagered.  Your cards are then split and you are now playing two
separate hands.

Doubling-Down
-------------
    You may Double-Down on any hand in this game, preferably when your hand
totals 10 or 11.  Player doubles his bet and is dealt only ONE more card.

Insurance
---------
    If you decide to take insurance you are insuring your hand in the event
the dealer has Blackjack.  Insurance pays 2 to 1, therefore, the insurance
wager should be 1/2 of your original bet.  If the dealer has Blackjack you
lose your original bet, but you are paid on your insurance, thus losing
nothing.
