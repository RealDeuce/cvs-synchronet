Release 08232000
    o Scores were showing as negative values.  Changed datatype to unsigned.
    o The 'T'itle option displayed the Store Menu.  Fixed.
    o Fixed some problems in the TEXT.DAT that were causing the game to
      GPF on some window boxes.
    o The number of possible modems and unused modem slots for the high end
      BBS software packages were showing up as a negative value.
    o When buying modems, it always said that 10 was the max that you can
      buy, no matter how much money you had.  It now checks to see if you
      have enough empty slots for your current BBS package.

Release 08202000
    o Money was showing as a negative when too much was accumulated.
    o Fixed a problem with the corrupt polititian.  You can no longer give
      him more than you have in the bank.  Also, you now get a little
      private education when you donate a proper ammount.
    o Fixed many problems with the tutors.
    o The Break Into an Office option of the 'Use Skills' menu now works.
    o Employees can no longer be used in personal menu.
    o The Shoplifing option now works.
    o Fixed a problem with the experience listing.
    o Fixed a problem where hacking a board gave way too much of a score.
    o Fixed a problem with the Top Ten list.  It wasn't sorting the list
      properly.
    o Made it so that when the 'A'nswer Chat command is used, an action is
      used up too.  It seems that people can continue getting subscriptions
      by hitting the 'A'nswer chat command, even if there were not pending
      chats.
    o Problem messages were not being displayed.  Fixed.
    o Removed the '=' command or the real sysop menu from the game.  In order
      to access the sysop menu, you must now start the game with the -CONFIG
      command line parameter.  This option does not care if you are the
      sysop or not.

Release 07092000
    o Uberhund of Darklands BBS reported:
     
      When a players accesses the "charge users" function, it seems that a
      counter within the game gets incremented, but the player doesn't get
      a turn deducted from their total. So they can hit "c" for charge users,
      then answer "no" to the "do you want to charge users" question, and
      they will receive things such as chat requests and subscriptions. So,
      theoretically, a user can receive unlimited money and additional users
      by just sitting there and hitting "c", "n" over and over again, and
      answering chat requests and getting subscription money.

      I've changed it so that the items get incremented only if the player
      chooses 'Y'es at the charge users prompt.

    o You can hold down any button that causes repetitive actions without
      turn-loss and still receive subscriptions and chat messages (even if
      you haven't just received a subscription

      A beautiful example of this is the "a" key,  which you can hold down
      and automagically answer any incoming chats, while generating more
      chats (and thus more users and $) and subscriptions. I got a few
      thousand callers and boucou dollars by doing this (especially if you
      pause in the middle to charge your users).

      I didn't want to do it this way, but if it's causing a problem, I'll
      have to make this change.  Now, if you hit 'A', even when there is
      no pending chat, you will have a turn decucted.

    o Fixed one or two cosmetic issues in the TEXT.DAT file.

Release 05142000
    o Happy Mothers Day!
    o When performing actions, the text would also show the ANSI color codes,
      instead of interpreting them.  Fixed.

    o If a player has less than 1 modem, one will be provided by a user.

Release 04242000
    o Changed release format from YYMMDD to MMDDYYYY.

    o Removed all the text from the game and placed it in the TEXT.DAT
      file.  This is in result of a DGROUP compiler error, which means
      that there were too many string constants in the program.

    o It has been reported that hitting 'R' when a subscripition arrives,
      it would be possible to keep accruing money.  I was not able to
      duplicate this phenomena.

    o When using a tutor, only one action would be used, instead of the listed 
      amount.

    o When hitting "Users Now Online", the game would error out.

    o No matter how many phone lines you buy at one time the same amount of
      money was charged.

    o If a harddrive level increased above the max, just high-ascii chars
      would be displayed.  It is now not possible to go past the max.


Release 990811

    o When charging a fee, some free users would join, and some would leave.
      It was possible for the number of free users to go below zero.  Fixed.

    o If you edited a player in the sysop menu, you would not be able to
      leave the sysop menu.  Fixed.

Release 990809

    o Fixed virus scan option.  TurboScan was alwasy being run when asked
      even if answered with No.

    o Fixed CPU Upgrade.  When receiving a computer upgrade resulting from
      a (W)ork action, the text would say 'You now have a #' where '#'
      would be the numeric value of the cpy type.  It now correctly displays
      the textual value of the cpu type.

    o Added action items #13 - Delete Modem, and #14 - Damage Phone line.
      Made changes to MSGSA.DAT and MSGSV.DAT to reflect the changes.

    o Changed MAINMENU.ANS to show the (Q)uit command.

    o When doing the (U)sers command, the figures would reflect how many
      modems the player had, and not the phone lines.  It was possible for
      a player to have fewer phone lines than modems but be treated as if
      he also had the same number of phone lines as modems.  Fixed.

Release 990806

    o Rewrote the function that increments the number of messages waiting
      to be read.  Previously, every action was generating about 4-8 new
      messages.  It now has a 40% chance of a single new message being
      added to the waiting list after each action.  Also, the score is no
      longer being reduced if mail is not read.

    o If new phone lines were ordered, they were not being installed during
      the next day's newday event.  Fixed.
