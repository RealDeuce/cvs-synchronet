Virtual Sysop 3 TODO:

  [ ] no matter how many phone lines you buy at the phone store, they always tell
      you that they will charge you $35.00 for installation.  They lie!  They
      charge you $35.00 x the number of lines being installed.
  [ ] education not working properly.  (not adding education, not deducting money)
  [ ] Hardware loss too often ... game balance issue.
  [ ] mail message reading/writing should be improved
  [ ] user file i/o should be more multinode friendly
  [ ] add packing routines for the mail file
  [ ] improve all daily maint to keep the game cleaner
  [ ] make one function to calculate available modems
  [ ] report shows wrong number of actions
  [ ] need to rewrite how user data is handled
  [ ] write function to calculate score, don't save it in user record
  [ ] need to filter user text input to remove unwanted characters
  [ ] check monitary transations to make sure they check balances before hand
  [ ] add logging to reduce cheating bugs
