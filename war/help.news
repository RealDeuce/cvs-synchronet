 Starting the Game

If you have never played WAR! before, you will be asked for your name 
and your nation mark.  You may use any name you wish, up to 14 
characters long.  This name will be used for your national leader (your 
first hero) and will be shown on status displays.  You do not have to 
use your real name.

Enter a single exclamation mark (!) in place of the name to try for a 
different city.

The nation mark is the letter you wish to be used to represent your 
nation's cities and armies in the game.  (Cities are uppercase, armies 
are lowercase.)

Next, you will be instructed to press a key to continue.  When you do,
the following screen will appear:

  City:  Verdant (Verdant)

  Welcome to Solomoriah's WAR!  Press ? for Help.

(Of course, your screen may show a different city, and you probably 
will name your hero something other than Victor...)

If you enter the game before the first turn update, you will have your
hero, your city, and one army.  For each turn after the first that
passes before you enter the game, you will have an additional army, up
to the limit of militia production (usually four or six).  This ensures 
you will not be helpless if you enter the game late.

The map uses the following symbols:

    . Plains     * Neutral City
    % Forest     ! Battle Zone
    # Hills
    ^ Mountains

(Blank space represents water.)


  Playing WAR!

Your first act upon entering the game will probably be to attack a
neutral city nearby.  To do so you will need to move your army(s) into
the city.

Note the pointer (->) beside the hero, Victor, on the screen view
above.  You use the <j> and <k> keys to move the pointer down or up.
If you press the <space bar> a * will appear next to the army the
pointer is pointing at.  (Pressing <space bar> again will remove the
*.)  You may also press <*> to select all, or </> to unselect all.

Once you have selected your armies, press <m> to move them.  A message
will appear at the bottom of the screen, as follows:

 Move Army          7 8 9               SPACE to Stop.
                    4   6
                    1 2 3

The keys shown move your army stack in the corresponding direction.
Note that if any army you have marked can't make a move, the entire
stack can't.

Next to each army name in the screen view, you will see a pair of
numbers separated by a colon.  The first number is the army's maximum
movement allowance, and the second is the amount remaining.  Note that
different armies may have different costs for moving through a given 
space.  Some terrain types may be totally impassable to a given army
type; for instance, cavalry can't move through mountains, and most
armies can't cross water.

When you reach the neutral city, note that it will cost 2 movement
points to enter.  (Entering a hostile city always costs 2 points;
friendly cities always cost 1 point.)  Once you have entered you will
see an exclamation point (!) indicating a battle zone.  You may not
move armies out of a battle zone... so you should then just press
<space bar> to finish moving.

You may stop an army or an army stack anywhere, not just in a city;
your remaining movement will still be available in that case.

When the turn update runs, all battles will be resolved.  Note that if
you attack a player-owned city, and he has moved additional armies
into the city, the results may not be as you expect.

The reason is, player commands are executed in random order.  The
nation list is scrambled, then each nation's commands are executed,
followed by battles.

For instance, say you and your neighbor, both players, go to war.  You
attack, moving a large army stack into a poorly-defended city.  He
expects this, and moves a large army stack into the same city to
defend it.

If his commands execute first, there will be one large battle, as
your army stack confronts his.  If your commands execute first, you may
capture his city, only to be crushed when his defensive force arrives.

Players may have as many as twelve armies in a friendly city.
However, no more than ten armies belonging to a given nation may be in
any other space, including an enemy city.  Note also that cities give
a bonus to the combat ratings of friendly units (the defense value).

Heros also give a bonus to friendly units they are grouped with.  Only
the most powerful hero in a stack grants the stack his bonus.  (Only
one commander per group.)


  Changing the View

The map shows your current group near the center; the cursor will be 
on the exact spot.  To move the "focus" to another group, use the
(n)ext and (p)revious commands.

Pressing <n> for next moves the focus to the next group, in map order,
which you own.  A group consists of a city and/or one or more armies.
All armies in the group will be displayed in the right-hand column.
Enemy army counts will be below your armies.  If the focus is on a
city, the city name and owning nation will be below the map display.

Similarly, <p> for previous moves to the previous group in map order.
If there are no previous groups (or no more groups for next), a
message will appear.

You may also press <N> or <P> (capitalized) to move to the very last 
(for N) or very first (for P) group.


 Viewing the Map

You may gain "recon" information about the map around any focus position 
by entering (i)nformation mode.  While in "info mode" you may move the
cursor around the screen, to any spot visible.  Notice that the focus
remains in the same place.

Information about the terrain and armies present in each spot you move the
cursor over is shown just above the info mode help display, at the bottom
of the screen.


 Status Display

The (s)tatus display shows the names of all nations, their rulers and nation
marks, and a count of their currently owned cities, armies, and heros.  
While in status display, you may use (n)ext and (p)revious to view other
pages, or press ESC to return to the normal display.


 Drafting Armies

Each city can produce as many as four different types of units.
Initially, each city is set up to produce the lowest-ranked unit type
it can produce.  You can change this for friendly cities by pressing
<a> for the armies command.  The available unit types will be shown,
along with the time to produce in parenthesis.  The current type in
production is also shown, along with the remaining time to produce the
unit.

If you change unit production, you lose any time spent producing a
different type.  For instance, if one of your cities is producing Lt.
Cavalry and needs four turns to produce a unit, and you have only two
turns left to produce, then changing unit types causes you to lose the
two turns you have spent already.

Not all cities take the same time to produce the same unit type.  Some
cities are better at producing certain types.  Also, not all cities
produce the same types of armies.


 Transporting Armies

Certain special army types have the ability to transport other armies.
For instance, a Navy unit can transport an entire stack of armies over
water spaces.  There are units able to transport entire stacks, single 
armies, or single heros.

To use a transporting unit, simply select it along with the units you
wish to have transported.  When you begin moving the stack, the movement
costs will be applied to the transporting army.  Armies being carried
pay a cost of 1 point per space moved through regardless of terrain
type, and do not have to stop when they reach 0 movement (as long as
the transporting army can still move).


 Special Hero Rules

As previously noted, a hero adds a bonus to all units stacked under him
(or her).  This bonus, called the Command value, varies from hero to hero.

Heros may make use of hero-transporting armies (such as Hippogryffs) as
noted above.

When a hero joins your nation, he or she has the movement capability (or
costs) of the lowest-ranked unit produced in the hero's home city.  For
most heros, this results in the hero moving like Lt. Infantry.  Elf 
heros, however, have regular Elf movement (making it easier to move 
through forests).


 Reading the News and Mail

You can read the News by pressing (R).  The News consists of information
about recent battles (in capsule form), captured cities, etc. of all
nations.

You can read your Mail by pressing (M).  The results of your military 
actions will be mailed to you in detail; also, you may receive mail from 
other national leaders this way.  To send Mail, press (S).  You may enter
the name of the leader, or the word All to post a message in the News.


 Browsing Unit Types

The (A)rmy types display shows the names of all the army types available
to all users in the game, their combat rating, their movement capabilites,
and if they can transport other units.  When in the army type display,
you may use (n)ext and (p)revious to view other pages or press ESC to
return to the normal display.
