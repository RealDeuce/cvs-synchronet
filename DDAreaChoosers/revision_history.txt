Revision History (change log)
=============================
Version  Date         Description
-------  ----         -----------
1.14     2017-08-30   Bug fix in the message area chooser: A function was not
                      implemented (result of a copy & paste where I didn't
                      include the missing function that was called).
1.13     2016-12-11   Updated the message area chooser to show the number of
                      readable messages rather than the actual total number of
                      messages in the sub-boards (in case some messages are
                      deleted, unverified, etc.)
1.12     2016-11-22   Updated the message area chooser to work better with
                      Synchronet 3.17.  Null message headers seem to be more
                      common with Synchronet 3.17 due to the message voting
                      feature that was introduced in that version.
1.11     2016-02-19   Bug fix: THe page number on the screen wasn't being updated
                      properly when navigating between screens in the message
                      group/file library list.
1.10     2016-02-15   Added the ability to display a custom header file above
                      the area lists in the area choosers.  Added the
                      configuration options areaChooserHdrFilenameBase and
                      areaChooserHdrMaxLines to specify the filename (without
                      the extension) and maximum number of lines from the header
                      file to use.  Also, when showing the message written
                      dates, the dates of all messages will be adjusted to the
                      BBS's local time zone for consistency.
1.09     2016-01-17   Added a command-line parameter to let the user choose a
                      message sub-board only within their current message
                      group, or file directory only within their current file
                      library.
1.08     2015-04-19   Added customizable color settings for the key help text
                      line displayed at the bottom of the screen in lightbar
                      mode.  Also, updated to allow the PageUp and PageDown
                      keys to be used instead of the P and N keys to go to the
                      previous & next pages in lightbar mode.
1.07     2014-12-22   Message area chooser:
                      Bug fix: Made this.colors.subBoardHeader apply to the
                      whole line rather than just the page number.
                      Bug fix: The initial display of the page number is now
                      correct (previously, it would start out saying page 1,
                      even if on another page).
                      Documentation & example configuration files:
                      Added the color options subBoardHeader (for the message
                      area chooser) and fileAreaHdr (for the file area chooser)
                      to the documentation and example configuration files.
1.06     2014-09-14   Bug fix: Updated the lightbar highlight format string to
                      include a normal attribute at the end to avoid the
                      highlight color to be used when clearing the screen,
                      etc.  Bug reported by Psi-Jack.
1.05     2013-05-10   Bug fix in the file area chooser: When listing
                      directories in a file group, it would sometimes
                      crash due to an incorrect array index used, and
                      the array was not set up.  Those have been fixed.
1.04     2013-05-04   Updated to properly format message sub-boards and
                      file directories with more than 9999 entries.  The
                      formatting is now dynamically adjusted depending
                      on the greatest number of entries in a sub-board
                      for a message group or file directory in a file
                      library (the descriptions will shrink as the
                      text length of the greatest number of entries
                      increases).
1.03     2012-11-30   Bug fix: After leaving the help screen from the
                      sub-board/directory list, the top line is now
                      correctly written with the page information as "Page
                      # of #".
1.02     2012-10-06   For the lightbar interface, the current page number is
                      now displayed at the top of the screen (along with the
                      total number of pages) and is updated when going to a
                      new page.
1.01     2011-04-22   Fixed the wording when choosing a message sub-board and
                      file library.
1.00     2010-03-13   First public release
